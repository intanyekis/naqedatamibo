Whether they're actors, singers, dancers or both - these people are generally regarded as untouchable and superior to the average person in most regards. They drive sparkling, expensive cars and live in mansions filled with only the finest of furnishings and appliances. We see them at appearances decked out in the best designer clothing and dripping in luxurious jewelry with their hair and makeup perfectly done - making all of us believe that everything in the world must be perfect. However, what we don't realize is that all this celebrity has to do most days is show up, sit in a chair and have everybody else do the work on their outward appearance for them. They're surrounded by the best stylists, make-up artists and assistants and generally aren't used to doing very much themselves.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This same principle is applied to celebrities' homes. The average person moves out of their parents' place when they become an adult and learn how to cook, clean and decorate for themselves as nobody else is around to do it for them. But when you're a famous singer or actor, you easily have the means to pay somebody else to do it for you - making it almost impossible for anyone to learn how to do it themselves. Below, we've compiled a list of the ten dirtiest celebrity homes. From leaving dishes full of food under the bed to not picking up after pets, it's clear that the famous people on this list were never taught how to properly manage a household - much to the dismay of their nannies.</p><h2 id=10-kristen-stewart><strong>10. Kristen Stewart</strong></h2><p>Via closermag.fr</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Kristin Stewart</a>'s notoriously questionable personal hygiene apparently also manifests itself when it comes to her housekeeping. One of her former housekeepers has revealed to tabloids that the Twilight actress has a nasty chain-smoking habit and leaves cigarette butts everywhere. She puffs away like a chimney and doesn't pick up after herself, leaving butts in the shower, in potted plants and even once in the fridge.</p><p></p><h2 id=9-brad-pitt-amp-angelina-jolie><strong>9. Brad Pitt & Angelina Jolie</strong></h2><p>Via nydailynews.com</p><p>According to <a href=#>Brad Pitt</a>&nbsp;and <a href=#>Angelina Jolie</a>'s former housekeepers, the married couple and their children live in a pigsty. While most celebrities hire help because they don't have a lot of time to clean up after themselves, the Pitt-Jolies live in complete chaos. There are pizza boxes everywhere and food is left out to rot. The kids write on the home's walls and have regular toothpaste wars. Pitt is a huge fan of architecture magazines and they are reportedly stacked all over the house and crammed into corners in true hoarder fashion.</p><p></p><h2 id=8-jessica-simpson><strong>8. Jessica Simpson</strong></h2><p>Via huffingtonpost.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Jessica Simpson</a> has been known to drive her housekeepers crazy by leaving her numerous hair extensions all over the place. While the former singer is now a fashion and hair accessories mogul, she definitely isn't successful on the cleaning front. Her closet is reportedly a disaster with clothing strewn all over the place and it looks like animals have&nbsp;been shedding all over her home due to the extensions being left on the floor. She also once terrified a housekeeper by leaving thick eyelashes in the bedroom, leaving the poor woman to believe she was staring at a fuzzy spider.</p><p></p><h2 id=7-megan-fox><strong>7. Megan Fox</strong></h2><p>Via celebuzz.com</p><p>The Transformers star is just as messy as she is beautiful. She owns squirrels as pets and a pig named "Piggy Smalls" that she lets roam free around her home. She's proclaimed that she has a bad habit of never flushing after herself in her house, which extends to when she visits other people's places as well - leaving parting gifts for them in their toilets. Fox has also said that she leaves her clothes on the floor when she takes them off as soon as she comes home.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=6-britney-spears><strong>6. Britney Spears</strong></h2><p>Via ppcorn.com</p><p>According to <a href=#>Britney Spears</a>' bodyguard, the pop singer has horrible personal hygiene that includes picking her nose in front of others, refusing to bathe, not using deodorant and not brushing her teeth. Her grooming habits are almost identical to her housekeeping ones and her past nannies have claimed that she would leave plates full of unfinished food everywhere, would eat in bed and that her home was constantly in a state of disarray. A maid of the popstar's once pulled out a plate of half-eaten burgers, fries and cookies from underneath her bed. She also flings her clothing all over the floor when changing and does not seem to care to pick it up.</p><p></p><h2 id=5-lindsay-lohan><strong>5. Lindsay Lohan</strong></h2><p>Via splashnewsonline.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Troubled actress <a href=#>Lindsay Lohan</a> reportedly has so many items of clothing in her tiny Soho apartment that she has employed assistants who's sole purpose it is to categorize the clothing and keep it organized so that she doesn't lose track of it. She has an entire room dedicated to being a closet and clothing can be found in it haphazardly tossed into pile after messy pile. Discarded and unopened purchases can be found lying around and one room is piled high with so many boxes of shoes that it can hardly be used. Friends of the star have worried that she is becoming a hoarder.</p><p></p><h2 id=4-miley-cyrus><strong>4. Miley Cyrus</strong></h2><p>Via abcnews.go.com</p><p><a href=#>Miley Cyrus</a>' home is like a small zoo. She's got several dogs and a pig, and doesn't seem to feel the need to house train any of them. Her home is covered in dog poop and strange stains, and she yells at her maids to clean up after her animals instead of providing them with discipline. Her place is so chaotic that onetime boyfriend Patrick Schwarzenegger refused to spend much time there. Her frequent use of recreational drugs also leaves a stale smoke odour to the place and ashtrays littered everywhere.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=3-kirstie-alley><strong>3. Kirstie Alley</strong></h2><p>Via forum.exscn.net</p><p><a href=#>Kirstie Alley</a> has admitted to spending over $40,000 a year on her pets; which include lemurs and several dogs. While the actress may go through a lot of effort to take care of her beloved creatures, the same can't be said for her home. Similarly to Miley Cyrus mentioned above, Alley's home has been overtaken by her animals and is covered in pet hair, accidents and a strange stench. I guess that's just something she's willing to live with when surrounded by enough animals to fill a small zoo.</p><p></p><h2 id=2-octomom><strong>2. Octomom</strong></h2><p>Via adweek.com</p><p>Remember infamous Octomom <a href=#>Nadya Suleman</a>? After a hairdresser reported her to authorities, child services investigated her home and its horrific living conditions. Two of her children were going to the washroom in a portable training toilet in the yard because the plumbing in the house was shot and some rooms had upwards of four mattresses in them. There was writing on the walls, food strewn about everywhere and dirty diapers on the floor. Sounds like Octomom has bit off way more than she can chew.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=1-robert-pattinson><strong>1. Robert Pattinson</strong></h2><p>Via fanpop.com</p><p><a href=#>Robert Pattinson</a>'s crew on the set of Twilight famously once said that he smelled terrible and never bathed. In an interview, the actor discussed how he doesn't feel the need to wash and is perfectly content doing so without it. His philosophy extends to his home too and he has readily admitted that his apartment is filthy. He said that an apartment is a place to sleep and the hair on his head is meant to justâ€¦hang out on his head. Why clean either?</p><p>Sources: <a href=#>radaronline.com</a>, <a href=#>dailymail.co.uk</a>, <a href=#>billboard.com</a>, <a href=#>mtv.com</a>, <a href=#>celebdirtylaundry.com</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmnrCgmru0tdWeZKWhlprAtcXLnmatp6BifnF5w6KpraGVqMFur8SlnJuqmanGbrTOppysZw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftop-10-dirtiest-celebrity-homes.html&text=Top%2010%20Celebrities%20With%20the%20Dirtiest%20Homes&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftop-10-dirtiest-celebrity-homes.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftop-10-dirtiest-celebrity-homes.html&title=Top%2010%20Celebrities%20With%20the%20Dirtiest%20Homes" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftop-10-dirtiest-celebrity-homes.html&title=Top%2010%20Celebrities%20With%20the%20Dirtiest%20Homes" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftop-10-dirtiest-celebrity-homes.html&title=Top%2010%20Celebrities%20With%20the%20Dirtiest%20Homes" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftop-10-dirtiest-celebrity-homes.html&description=Top%2010%20Celebrities%20With%20the%20Dirtiest%20Homes" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-author-peggy-caserta-everything-about-author-lover-and-girlfriend-of-janis-joplin.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Author Peggy Caserta?
