The show has gone from strength to strength since it began, following along the Shelby family as they grow their empire through any means necessary, coming into conflict with both gangs and the government along the way.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=#> The 10 Highest-Grossing Slasher Films Of All Time</a></span></p><p>Within this article, we will take a look at the cast who have helped make the show such a major success, ranking them in terms of their net worths.</p><h2 id=sophie-rundle-net-worth-500-000>Sophie Rundle (Net Worth $500,000)</h2><p>We kick things off with Sophie Rundle who portrays Ada Shelby in Peaky Blinders, and is certainly the brains of the family, with Ada being the least violent and more rational member of the clan.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, that doesn't mean her character avoids all the trouble, as Ada can certainly mix it up as well, being a woman that you wouldn't want to mess with, but is more focused on trying to stay on the straight and narrow. The show has been a major break for Rundle as an actress, helping her grow her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth </a>to $500,000, although she does have major roles in popular shows, Jamestown and<strong>&nbsp;</strong>The Bletchley Circle.</p><h2 id=natasha-o-keeffe-net-worth-1-million>Natasha O'Keeffe (Net Worth: $1 Million)</h2><p>While Peaky Blinders might seem like a male-dominated show, the fact is that the women actually hold a lot of the power and Natasha O'Keeffe's character, Lizzie Shelby, who earns that name by marrying the lead character, Tommy Shelby.</p><p>Lizzie's character has a fantastic story arch, starting off with absolutely no power or control, she slowly works her way up the business, becoming one of the most important people in the show. Outside of the Peaky Blinders world, Natasha O'Keeffe is best known for her role on Misfits, which alongside many other roles has helped her grow a net worth of over $1 million.</p><h2 id=paul-anderson-net-worth-2-million>Paul Anderson (Net Worth: $2 Million)</h2><p>Paul Anderson plays one of the most popular characters in the Peaky Blinders franchise as the unhinged Arthur Shelby, who is the most violent and crazed character on the entire show, which is saying a lot.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Throughout the series, Arthur slowly breaks down mentally and shows even less remorse for all of his actions as he is often sent to do the bidding of the Peaky Blinders' most dangerous and deadly work. The show has done an incredible job building Anderson's reputation as an actor, and since then he managed to pick up a major role in The Revenant, which helped build his $2 million <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth.</a></p><h2 id=finn-cole-net-worth-2-million>Finn Cole (Net Worth: $2 Million)</h2><p>Another actor from the Peaky Blinders cast with an estimated net worth of $2 million is Finn Cole, who plays Michael Gray, which is a character that joined the show later on in the season, but certainly made a big impact.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=#> The Net Worth Of The Pirates Of The Caribbean Cast, Ranked&nbsp;</a></span></p><p>While Michael played happy family's for large parts of the show, in the most recent season it has been clear that he no longer has the desire to be a Peaky Blinder, creating a rift in the family which is set to be explored even more in the next season. Away from the show, Finn Cole is best known for his role in Animal Kingdom as well as making movie appearances in the likes of&nbsp;Here Are the Young Men and Dreamland.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=helen-mccrory-net-worth-5-million>Helen McCrory (Net Worth: $5 Million)</h2><p>Helen McCrory has a net worth of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$5 million</a> after an incredible career in the acting world, and her performances as Polly Gray in Peaky Blinders certainly rank up amongst the very best of her career so far. On the surface, Polly might not look like someone to fear, but a case can certainly be made that she is one of the most calculated and deadly characters on the entire show, with family meaning everything to her.</p><p>McCrory plays the role to perfection, with lots of sly glances helping to tell her story, although many fans of the actress may also know her from the Harry Potter franchise where she plays&nbsp;Narcissa Malfoy.</p><h2 id=aiden-gillen-net-worth-8-million>Aiden Gillen (Net Worth: $8 Million)</h2><p>Within Peaky Blinders, Aiden Gillen plays Aberama Gold who is a Romany Gypsy hitman-for-hire, a man with a reputation for being incredibly dangerous, while also being in love with a member of the Shelby family. It is through his love with Polly Gray that Gillen's character winds up being involved with the Peaky Blinders, with his character playing a major role in the most recent season of the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Crazy Expensive Things Ellen DeGeneres Has Bought</a></span></p><p>While Gillen has been highly involved in Peaky Blinders, his $8 million net worth and popularity have mainly come through his role on Game of Thrones, where he portrayed the vile, Little Finger.</p><h2 id=cillian-murphy-net-worth-15-million>Cillian Murphy (Net Worth: $15 Million)</h2><p>Cillian Murphy is an incredibly talented actor who portrays the main character within the Peaky Blinders show as the leader of the group, Thomas Shelby, where he has impressed, especially with his accent work. Murphy is one of the main reasons that the show has been such a hit, with his performances being absolutely incredible, being able to tone it down to be quiet and eerie, while also quite easily flipping a switch to go mental at the same time.</p><p>Outside of the hit show, Murphy has appeared in many top movies, especially those created by Christopher Nolan, such as Dunkirk and Batman Begins and Dark Knight Rises, helping to earn him a <a href=#>net worth of $15 million</a>.</p><h2 id=adrien-brody-net-worth-16-million>Adrien Brody (Net Worth: $16 Million)</h2><p>Adrien Brody just beats out the lead actor of Peaky Blinders, with <a href=#>a net worth of $16 million</a> which he has earned throughout his career, appearing in the likes of The Pianist and The Village.&nbsp;</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=#> 10 Perks You Can Only Experience In Luxury Hotels</a></span></p><p>Within the Peaky Blinders world, Brody plays&nbsp;Luca Changretta who is the main antagonist for the fourth season of the show, going up against Tommy Shelby head-on and challenging the Peaky Blinder as nobody has before. Luca brought the New York mafia across the pond in an attempt to rid the world of the Peaky Blinders, which was arguably the biggest storyline that the company has ever done.</p><h2 id=sam-neill-net-worth-18-million>Sam Neill (Net Worth: $18 Million)</h2><p>Sam Neill is an incredibly talented Northern Irish actor who has appeared in some huge movies, with most people recognizing him from Jurassic Park, where he portrays one of the lead roles.</p><p>Bringing him into the Peaky Blinders cast was a huge deal for the show and certainly helped him grow his net worth, which currently stands <a href=#>at $18 million</a>, and Neill showed everyone his worth in his excellent performances. His character,&nbsp;Major Chester Campbell is someone who fans loved to hate and remains the best antagonist that the show has ever had, which is largely down to his excellent acting.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tom-hardy-net-worth-30-million>Tom Hardy (Net Worth: $30 Million)</h2><p>The fact that a BBC drama show was able to bring in an actor the calibre of Tom Hardy highlights just how far television has come, with shows now being able to attract A-list actors to the cast.</p><p>While Hardy isn't one of the main characters in Peaky Blinders, and he hasn't been part of every season, his role as Alfie Solomons has been one of the highlights of the show every time he pops up, with this being a character you simply do not mess with. Even though Hardy is excellent in the television show, <a href=#>his $30 million net worth </a>has come from his movie career, appearing in films such as Inception, Dark Knight Rises, and most recently Venom.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>MCU: The 10 Richest Members, Ranked</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmrZ2cmsOqv8iopWiolZa4unnBpaCnnJWnwG6vwKyrZqaVqXq4u9Gtn2g%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fpeaky-blinders-cast-net-worth.html&text=Ranking%20The%20Net%20Worth%20Of%20The%20Cast%20Of%20Peaky%20Blinders&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fpeaky-blinders-cast-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fpeaky-blinders-cast-net-worth.html&title=Ranking%20The%20Net%20Worth%20Of%20The%20Cast%20Of%20Peaky%20Blinders" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fpeaky-blinders-cast-net-worth.html&title=Ranking%20The%20Net%20Worth%20Of%20The%20Cast%20Of%20Peaky%20Blinders" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fpeaky-blinders-cast-net-worth.html&title=Ranking%20The%20Net%20Worth%20Of%20The%20Cast%20Of%20Peaky%20Blinders" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fpeaky-blinders-cast-net-worth.html&description=Ranking%20The%20Net%20Worth%20Of%20The%20Cast%20Of%20Peaky%20Blinders" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./summer-house-marthas-vineyard-cast-photos.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Summer House: Marthas Vineyard Cast: Photos  Hollywood Life">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./katerina-taxia-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-195869-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Katerina Taxia Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
