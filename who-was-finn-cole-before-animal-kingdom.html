The series has been a thrill ride for fans, and many consider it to be quite underrated.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Cole has earned an impressive net worth</a> during his time on the show, and he stacks up well to <a href=#>the net worths of his Animal Kingdom co-stars</a>. Before getting cast on the show, he was putting in lots of work, including being featured on a popular show the got huge on <a href=#>Netflix</a>.</p><p>Let's take a deeper dive on Finn Cole and who he was before Animal Kingdom.</p><h2 id=finn-cole-has-been-great-as-j-cody-on-animal-kingdom>Finn Cole Has Been Great As J. Cody On Animal Kingdom</h2><p>In 2016, Animal Kingdom made its way across the pond and onto the small screen for a new audience. The Cody family got their start in an Australian movie, and the decision to bring them stateside was a wise one.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Finn Cole was cast as Joshua Cody on the show, and he took no time at all to show the world what he was capable of as a series lead. For the first four seasons, Cole was great on the show, and things continued to improve as the show went on.</p><p>Animal Kingdom recently wrapped up season 5, which upped the ante from the fallout of season four. Prior to the explosive season getting underway, Cole spoke on the direction that the show was heading.</p><p>"We’re back to figuring out how to survive without our leader. Without spoiling it, there’s a lot to be excited about in the upcoming season. We start to see these characters coming out of their shells a little bit more and explore different parts of their personalities. There’s a lot more action going on, too," he said.</p><p>The show has another season on deck, and this will give Cole another chance to shine as J Cody. He's been superb on the series, and before he was cast on Animal Kingdom, he was turning in great work on another hit show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Truth About Why Ellen Barkin Was Killed Off Of 'Animal Kingdom'</a></span></p><h2 id=39-peaky-blinders-39-was-his-big-break>'Peaky Blinders' Was His Big Break</h2><p>Two years before debuting on Animal Kingdom, the actor was cast on Peaky Blinders, and over time, his role on the show has grown. This is a testament to just how great Cole is on screen, and how great his character is.</p><p>When talking about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his character's trajectory</a> for season 6, Cole said, "He could be the one who betrayed Tommy, but there are a number of other candidates. I think going up against Tommy would probably be a mistake. I hope [Michael] doesn’t betray the family too much because people really didn’t like it last time. But it’s very exciting I can’t wait to get back to work and for the fans to see it because they’ve been waiting so patiently for so long now: it’s about time we gave them something.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Peaky Blinders does not have many episodes left, and you had better believe that Cole and the rest of the cast will be stepping things up to close the show on a high note.</p><p>Of course, Cole wasn't just handed his big break on Peaky Blinders. He was busy getting experience in smaller roles beforehand.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Who Was Julia Garner Before Portraying Anna Delvey In Netflix's 'Inventing Anna'?</a></span></p><h2 id=he-39-s-continued-working-while-on-39-animal-kingdom-39>He's Continued Working While On 'Animal Kingdom'</h2><p>Prior to his big break, Cole did have a role as an extra in the movie Offender. This wasn't much, but it certainly got things rolling.</p><p>After Peaky Blinders helped him take off, he started scoring other roles that preceded his time on Animal Kingdom. In fact, even after getting on Animal Kingdom, Cole has continued to take roles in other projects.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One project of note was 2019's Dreamland, which featured Cole and Margot Robbie staring alongside one another.</p><p>In an interview, Cole talked about what made the film such an attractive project.</p><p>"Coming-of-age stories are always appealing, especially as a young man who’s still trying to figure out this complicated world. The time period was also attractive. Everything in that era of the 1930s was built to last — cars, buildings, weapons. There was so much passion in everything that was created. The design on vehicles, the costumes, it’s like a different world. And as I started to uncover who was involved, my enthusiasm grew and grew," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he said</a>.</p><p>It's truly amazing to see the work that he put in before Animal Kingdom, and it's even more impressive to see what he has done since starring on the show.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Dan Levy Had An Extensive Career As A TV Host Before 'Schitt's Creek'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Animal Kingdom's 6th and final season in guaranteed to please fans, and Cole would love nothing more than to finish the show in style.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Who Was Karl Urban Before 'The Boys'?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddrK60ecWipadlk6S5pnnBnp2oqpVirq%2B1zJqjZqOZo7Slu8xo</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-was-finn-cole-before-animal-kingdom.html&text=Who%20Was%20Finn%20Cole%20Before%20Starring%20On%20%27Animal%20Kingdom%27%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-was-finn-cole-before-animal-kingdom.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-was-finn-cole-before-animal-kingdom.html&title=Who%20Was%20Finn%20Cole%20Before%20Starring%20On%20%27Animal%20Kingdom%27%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-was-finn-cole-before-animal-kingdom.html&title=Who%20Was%20Finn%20Cole%20Before%20Starring%20On%20%27Animal%20Kingdom%27%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-was-finn-cole-before-animal-kingdom.html&title=Who%20Was%20Finn%20Cole%20Before%20Starring%20On%20%27Animal%20Kingdom%27%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-was-finn-cole-before-animal-kingdom.html&description=Who%20Was%20Finn%20Cole%20Before%20Starring%20On%20%27Animal%20Kingdom%27%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./net-worth-status-updates-former-tv-favorites.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="5 Net Worth &amp;amp; Status Updates On Former TV Favorites">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./ron-hall-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-550487-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ron Hall Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
