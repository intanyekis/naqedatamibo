長年、水カンの顔だったのがボーカルのコムアイさんでした。
しかし、2021年9月にコムアイさんが水カンを脱退し、新たに詩羽さんが新ボーカルに就任しました。
このボーカルの変更に関してはファンの間では賛否あるみたいです。
すでに多くの方が詩羽さんのことを”可愛い！”と気に入っていますが・・・。
今日は詩羽さんについての詳細と、前ボーカルのコムアイさんについて書いてみたいと思います。
水曜日のカンパネラのボーカル・詩羽と前ボーカル・コムアイ 超個性的なバンド”水曜日のカンパネラ”ですが、旧ボーカルも新ボーカルも超個性的です。
年齢はコムアイさんの方が詩羽さんよりもひと回り違いますが、本質的な部分で似てるように思えます。
派手で過激なビジュアルも２人共よく似ています。
ミュージシャンとしての人生のチューニングがやり過ぎてない感じも共通してます。

詩羽は芸術大学に通うモデル。ミスIDで受賞の経歴！ 詩羽さんは水曜日のカンパネラに加入するまでにアーティスト的な仕事はしたことがありませんでした。
2020年にミスIDのオーディションに挑むと、圧倒的な個性が受け、見事に「赤澤える賞」を受賞しました。
詩羽さんのミスIDでの紹介プロフィールがまたネットに残っております。
詩羽のミスIDのプロフィール 詩羽さんはミスIDに挑んでた時点から、歌が好きで、アコギでの弾き語りが趣味だと書いていました。
好きなアーティストはクリープハイプで、高校3年間は軽音楽部に所属していたそうです。
はじめまして、詩羽です。口に２つのピアスがチャームポイント。猫が好き。音楽と詩と時間と一緒に生きています🎞私のInstagramを見て欲しい！きっと好きになってくれる人がいるはず。お前なんかミスiDになれねえよ！と誰かに言われても、誰かは応援してくれると思っているし、誰かが私を嫌いでも、誰かは私を大好きだと思います。だから思い立ったら今！！チャンスは自分で掴むものだと思って、私は今、行動してみました。昔の私みたいに、自分が嫌いだったり自信が持てなかったり、毎日が不安だったり、自分を好きになりたい人の味方でありたいです。あなたのための詩羽になります。
ミスIDの時から音楽が好きなことが分かる言及が多かったですが、トータルでクリエイティブなことが好みという印象です。
詩羽さん本人も芸術系の大学に通っていたということで、それは当然ですね！
詩羽が水曜日のカンパネラに加入した経緯。コムアイへのリスペクト 詩羽さんが水カンに加入してきっかけは、知人の紹介を通じてDir.Fさんと知り合ったことです。
知り合っていくうちに、打ち解け、水カンに加入されたそうです。
オーディションなどは全くなく、ぶっつけで決まったそうです。
水カンのボーカルになった際の感想を、インタビューで述べていました。
「やったー！嬉しい！」っていう気持ち。夜になって一人で冷静に考えてみたら「あれ...これってもしかしてかなりすごい話なのでは！？」と徐々に事の重大さを実感してきて（笑）。ちょっと不安な気持ちにもなりましたが、楽しみな気持ちの方が大きかったです。
最初はことの重大さに気づかなかったらしいのですが、実感が沸くにつれで不安な気持ちになったそうです。
過去の水曜日のカンパネラのライブでコムアイを研究？ ちなみに詩羽さんは、すでにコムアイさんに会って、話もしたそうです。
とてもリスペクトできる人だという印象だそうです。
本当に尊敬できる人。自分の意志がはっきりとあって、自分の目指すものに対して真っ直ぐに向き合う姿にとても憧れています。
そして「水曜日のカンパネラ」の楽曲で特に好きな楽曲は「桃太郎」だそうで、リリースされた当時から聴いており、当時すごく衝撃を受けた楽曲だったそうです。
過去の水カンのライブ映像などを観て、色々と研究してるそうで、とても真面目に取り組んでることがわかります。
そうですね。やっぱり初ライブの前は、コムアイさんの動画を見てパフォーマンスを研究していました。これまで水カンが積み上げてきたものを大事にしながら、どのくらい自分らしさを出せるのか、みたいなことは悩みましたね。 でも、ライブの数をこなしていくうちに、やっぱりコムアイさんにしかできないことがあって、それは逆もしかりなんだなって気づいてからは、楽しめるようになりました。
それでも、コムアイさんと自分は別だとして、コムアイさんにしかできなかったことを無理にやるつもりはないそうです。
コムアイさんはコムアイさんの良さがあって、詩羽さんには詩羽さんにしかできなことがあると、割り切っているようです。</description></item><item><title>All About Magi Salah | Age, Net Worth, Relationship, Career</title><link>/all-about-magi-salah-age-net-worth-relationship-career.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>youremail@domain.com (Some Person)</author><guid>/all-about-magi-salah-age-net-worth-relationship-career.html</guid><description>Magi Salah is married to Egyptian professional footballer Mohamed Salah.

半世紀以上も聖飢魔IIの世界観を守り続けている根気の良さは、YOSHIKIさんやGACKTさんをも凌ぐ意志の強さです。
しかしながら、過去にネット上でデーモン閣下の素顔やメイクなしの画像が流出したことがあります。
今日はデーモン閣下の素顔、メイクなしの顔の写真を紹介すると共に、デーモン閣下の意外な経歴や性格について書いてみたいと思います。
デーモン閣下の素顔はデビュー前からバレてる？過去のメディアやNHKですっぴん披露？ 何十年も芸能界にいながらも、意地でもメイクを外さないデーモン閣下。
現在も素顔を隠すことに関してはプロフェッショナルで、スマホが普及した今もリアルタイムに素顔が出回ることはありません。
デーモン閣下曰く、「メイクした顔が素顔」と言い切っています。すごいですね。
過去に直近のデーモン閣下だと思われる画像が流出したことがありました。
作者は不明のまま２０１２年頃からSNSを中心に拡散されているものです。
しかし、この画像はフェイクであり、誰かが作成したガセ写真でありました。
今のデーモン閣下のすっぴんはわかりませんが、閣下がまだ若かった素人時代にテレビに出演した際の素顔の写真はいくつかネットで出回っています。
デーモン閣下が若い頃に出演したメディアで素顔が発覚！ デーモン閣下は早稲田大学に在籍していた素人時代に何度かテレビに出演されています。
一般人だった頃からアクティブでクリエイティブな人間だったということですね！
大学時代に武田鉄矢さん&amp;amp;島田紳助さんが司会を務める番組に『早稲田ウルトラ警備隊』というグループとして出演したことがあるんです。
当時の閣下はゴジラの鳴き真似コンテストに出場して見事に優勝してます！
一時、YouTubeにコンテストに出演する閣下の動画がアップされていましたが、現在は削除されています。
ちなみに閣下は早稲田大学在学時には『ウルトラ警備隊』以外にも多数のバンドに所属していました。
↓分かる範囲でこれぐらいのバンドやユニットに所属していました。
『走り幅跳び』 『顔面大陸棚』 『生老婆（ナマローバ）』 『紫馬肥（ムラサキウマゴヤシ）』 『私的独占の禁止及び公正取引の確保に関するバンド』 デーモン閣下の本名や秀才な素顔。相撲解説で賢さがバレる

出身大学：早稲田大学社会学部
活動期間：聖飢魔IIで1985年にデビュー（結成は1982年）
結婚：既婚
父：銀行員
姉：小暮裕美子（記者。アナウンサー。）
デーモン閣下の相撲解説が人気？姉・裕美子はエリート街道を走る！ デーモン閣下といえば、大の相撲好きとして有名です。
現在では相撲解説を務め、その的確な解説は多くの相撲ファンから認められています。
早稲田大学を卒業した賢さは確かで、言葉使いや専門用語の使い方が洗練されていて、とてもバンドマンとは思えないです。
ちなみにデーコン閣下の姉である小暮裕美子さんは慶應大学を卒業し、記者→アナウンサーとして活躍され、現在はお偉いさんに出世してるエリートであります。
兄弟揃って、バリバリの秀才だということですね！
ちなみにデーモン閣下が相撲に詳しいのは、祖父が旅順工科大学で相撲部に所属していたことが影響しています。
デーモン閣下は自宅にある相撲関係の文献を読みあさり、子供時代から砂場で相撲して遊んだり、大学時代も力士になりたいと相撲同好会にも所属していたそうです。
デーモン閣下は既に結婚して子供がいる？離婚や娘の現在 デーモン閣下は長く熱愛や結婚の噂はあまり聞きません。
それだけ、長く生々しい人間らしさを隠して活動できているということですね。
しかし、少し前に結婚していることや、子供がいることが週刊誌に書かれました。
1993年に、閣下に隠してる妻子がいるとの報道がありました。
”隠し妻子”が女性誌にキャッチされたのは1993年秋…
1月に記者会見を開いた閣下は「我が輩は悪魔だけど、生命の誕生はうれしい」、「我が輩の子供として認知する」と、9月に娘が生まれたことを認めました。
翌1994年1月上旬、女性誌に「閣下はA子さんとは結婚しない」との極秘電話が寄せられます。
1月中旬、閣下はA子さんとケンカして以来、会わなくなっていました。
当時、しっかりと会見で子供が生まれたことを明かしていたようです。
ただ、その娘を産んだ女性と閣下は遊びであり、子供が生まれた時には閣下には他の女性がいたそうです。</description></item><item><title>20 Other Things About His House And Lifestyle</title><link>/shaq-has-the-biggest-custom-made-mattress-20-other-weird-things-about-his-house-and-lifestyle.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>youremail@domain.com (Some Person)</author><guid>/shaq-has-the-biggest-custom-made-mattress-20-other-weird-things-about-his-house-and-lifestyle.html</guid><description>Quick LinksThe Other (Massive) Bed The Big Day (Million-Dollar Investment...
