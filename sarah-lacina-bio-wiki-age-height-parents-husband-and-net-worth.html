The theme of the season was “Brawn vs. Brains vs. Beauty.” As a police officer, she started on the “Brawn” tribe (Aparri). She immediately recognized that her tribe mate Tony Vlachos was also a cop, and though she tried to confront him about it, Vlachos denied it. However, he later told her he was a cop, and the two formed an alliance called Cops-R-Us. Aparri won the first four immunity challenges, but after the tribe swap, she was the only original Aparri member to remain on that tribe.</p><p>She managed to reach the merge; however, after Solana, the other tribe left in the game, won the final pre-merge immunity challenge, Vlachos hugged the other four members of Solana while screaming “Top five!”, which made her question Vlachos’s loyalty. Following the merge, Lacina was the swing vote between the old Aparri alliance and the old Solana alliance, and she became indecisive about her position. Vlachos tried to sway her back to his side, but she chose not to go back because she did not trust him.</p><p>She wanted to vote him out at the first post-merge Tribal Council, but she ultimately agreed with the other members of the Aparri alliance to target Jefra Bland. However, Trish Hegarty of the Solana alliance wanted to target Lacina, and she pleaded with Kass McQuillen of the Aparri alliance to flip. At Tribal Council, McQuillen flipped and joined the Solana alliance in blindsiding Lacina. She finished in 11th place and was the first member of the jury.</p><p>At the Final Tribal Council, Lacina voiced her frustration to Vlachos for swearing on his badge and going back on his word and said she would have never done that. However, she ultimately cast her vote for Vlachos to win, which he did in an 8–1 vote.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=won-the-34th-season-of-survivor></span><span>Won the 34th Season of Survivor</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Lacina returns to the game as a contestant in the 34 seasons of Survivor after finishing 11th in Survivor: Cagayan. Tony Vlachos, who has already won the Survivor competition, is a fun tidbit about her. She was initially assigned to the Nuku tribe and was partnered with Cirie Fields. Initially, she overcame several obstacles and played a very safe and clever game, making it to the finals. She won the solitary survivor title during the final tribal council by receiving the majority of the council members’ votes.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=frequently-asked-questions-about-sarah-lacina></span><span>Frequently Asked Questions About Sarah Lacina</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><strong class=schema-faq-question>Who is Sarah Lacina?</strong><p class=schema-faq-answer>Sarah Lacina is an American police officer best known for competing on the American reality show Survivor.
