Though the vessel burst into flames several minutes after successfully landing, the testing phase is getting more and more sophisticated. With his infallible vision to get to Mars in the next few years, Musk recently moved to Texas, where he is close to the <a href=#>Tesla </a>and SpaceX offices. Embracing the spirit of minimalism, Musk recently sold several of his mansions, after he announced via Twitter in 2020 via Twitter that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he would be selling almost all of his real estate.&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;With sales estimated at $137 million for 7 different properties, Musk is quickly liquidating his array of stunning homes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While we don't know what type of living quarters Elon has settled into in Texas, he is already planning to build an entire space-related city there. The plan is to create a city called 'Starbase', which will encompass the current SpaceX rocket-building and testing facility.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>6 Innovative Features In Elon Musk's Future City, Cost Ranked</a></span></p><h2 id=gene-wilder-house-7-million>Gene Wilder House: $ 7 Million</h2><p>In the summer of 2020, Elon Musk sold the famous <a href=#>Gene Wilder</a> house to Gene Wilder's nephew, for a cool $7,000,000, which is $250,000 more than he paid for the property in 2013. The sleepy home, which is virtually invisible from the street, is located in the Bel-Air region, a neighborhood that Musk has occupied for years. While he never actually lived in this home, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he did use it as a private educational base for his own children</a>, and for the children of his SpaceX and Tesla employees.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The home is legendary in Hollywood, as it was once occupied by Gene Wilder, the actor made famous for his role as Willie Wonka in <a href=#>Willie Wonka And The Chocolate Factory</a>.&nbsp;The ranch-style home has a lot of old, original charm, which was one of the main things that attracted Musk when he originally purchased the home. He specifically didn't want to alter or renovate the home, in order to retain it's original essence. He was happy to pass the torch back to the nephew of Gene Wilder, so that the home could continue with the original family line.</p><h2 id=bel-air-mansion-29-million>Bel Air Mansion: $29 Million</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Musk's Bel-Air mansion is one of the most impressive celebrity homes, and Elon made an impressive profit from the recent sale. Purchased for $17,000,000 in 2012, the property was sold to Chinese tech billionaire, Ding Lei,&nbsp; who was once coined as '<a href=#>China's richest man</a>', for $29,000,000, in 2020.</p><p>The property boasts 16,250 square feet of space, including six large bedrooms, eleven bathrooms, an impressive two-story library, swimming pool, and large tennis court area. The luxurious location overlooks the Bel-Air Country Club, and features an impressive outdoor area, with pathways, gardens, and a fruit orchard. The home is one of a cluster of 4 Los Angeles homes that Musk bought, alleging that too many fans were trying to spy on him by approaching the properties before he bought them all out. This elaborate home certainly has enough space for guests, large families, and parties!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=los-angeles-4-home-cluster-62-million>Los Angeles 4 Home Cluster: $62 Million</h2><p>The Los Angeles cluster of four homes that Musk previously owned were all listed for sale in early 2020, and the collection sold (to different buyers) for a total of $62,000,000. Musk listed all four of his Bel-Air properties in spring of 2020, after citing on Twitter that he planned to move towards a more minimalist lifestyle, and would be selling most of his properties. Four of these properties were neighboring homes, that ensured total privacy for the <a href=#>Tesla</a> and SpaceX CEO and his family. While the initial claim was met with skepticism, the past year has proved that Elon meant business! The four properties he sold include a 'Boomerang' pad that was initially bought for $3.7 Million&nbsp; in 2014. The home, which is shaped like a boomerang, sold for $4 Million last year.&nbsp; Of course, the massive mansion that then sold for $29 Million was also part of the fleet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While it's impressive that one of the richest men in the world is embracing a minimalist life, Elon Musk continues to do very big things in his professional, entrepreneurial life. Downsizing his properties might also be a temporary thing; <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">with a net worth of $176 Billion</a>, he can definitely afford to buy as many homes as he desires, down the line.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>4 Ex-Employees Of Elon Musk Who Are Now His Billionaire Rivals</a></span></p><p>SOURCES:<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Vanity Fair</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram&nbsp;</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Mercury News</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS6tr%2FKrGSfp6KisrN5zJqlrKGfo8Bw</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmusks-former-mansions.html&text=3%20Of%20Elon%20Musk%27s%20Former%20Mansions%2c%20Worth%20Ranked&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmusks-former-mansions.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmusks-former-mansions.html&title=3%20Of%20Elon%20Musk%27s%20Former%20Mansions%2c%20Worth%20Ranked" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmusks-former-mansions.html&title=3%20Of%20Elon%20Musk%27s%20Former%20Mansions%2c%20Worth%20Ranked" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmusks-former-mansions.html&title=3%20Of%20Elon%20Musk%27s%20Former%20Mansions%2c%20Worth%20Ranked" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmusks-former-mansions.html&description=3%20Of%20Elon%20Musk%27s%20Former%20Mansions%2c%20Worth%20Ranked" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./doyle-brunson-bio-age-net-worth-relationship-career.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Doyle Brunson | Bio, Age, Net Worth, Relationship, Career">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./supernatural-cast-where-are-they-now.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Supernatural Cast: Where Are They Now?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
