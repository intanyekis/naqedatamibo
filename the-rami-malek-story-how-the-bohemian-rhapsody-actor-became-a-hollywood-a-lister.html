During the initial years, he faced multiple rejections and small-time acting roles but slowly received recognition after starring in guest roles in television shows. It wasn’t until he starred in the 2006 hit film <i>Night At The Museum</i> that Malek became a known face in Hollywood. Rami Malek has become a household name through his work on the show <i>Mr. Robot</i> and <a href=#>his performance as Freddie Mercury in </a><a href=#><i>Bohemian Rhapsody</i></a>. He receives many prestigious accolades, including an Emmy and an Oscar.</p><p>After working hard in Hollywood, Rami Malek has been sweeping awards for his popular performances in movies and television shows for the last few years. From starring as a Pharaoh in <i>Night At The Museum</i> to becoming a bond supervillain, let’s look at how Rami Mark built his $20 million empire.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=struggling-for-a-hollywood-breakthrough>Struggling For A Hollywood Breakthrough</h2><p>Rami Malek hails from Torrance, California, where he grew up with his parents, sister, and twin sibling Sami. While attending Notre Dame High School, Malek became a part of the debate team, and while his rhetoric was weak, he impressed everyone with his dramatic interpretations. It was then his teacher saw his ability to perform in theater. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Malek studied drama at the University of Evansville and earned an internship at Eugene O’Neill Theater. Since his dream was to enter show business, he moved to New York to make his aspirations a reality. After performing in several plays, the actor finally moved to Los Angeles to try his luck.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>How HIMYM Star Cobie Smulders Built Her $25 Million Fortune</a></span></p><p>While attending auditions for various roles, Rami Malek made sandwiches and delivered pizzas as part-time jobs. His attempts continued to fail, but casting agent Mara Casey got him a role in an <a href=#>episode of </a><a href=#><i>Gilmore Girls</i></a><a href=#> in 2004</a>, which helped him gain momentum. A year later, he had small arcs on shows <i>Over There, </i>and <i>Medium</i> before Malek forayed into television. His breakthrough and debut occurred in 2006 with <i>Night At The Museum</i>, where he was cast as ancient pharaoh Ahkmenrah. He starred alongside Ben Stiller and Robin Williams and returned for its subsequent sequels, as noted by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Collider</a>.</p><h2 id=gaining-recognition-through-television>Gaining Recognition Through Television</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><i>Night At The Museum</i> was Rami Malek’s saving grace as he never had to doubt his acting career second again. The actor continued working in television and movies, keeping a balance between his roles. Malek returned to television in 2010 with <i>24</i> and starred as a suicide bomber for its eighth season. His other notable TV credits include <i>The Pacific</i>, <i>Alcatraz</i>, <i>Believe</i>, <i>The Legend Of Korra</i>, and <i>Snafu</i>. Malek also had supporting roles in multiple movies, from the science-fiction thriller <i>Battleship</i> to the fantasy romance sequel <i>The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 2</i>.</p><p>Rami Malek still needed to receive his most-recognized role in television which occurred in 2015 when he was cast as the lead in <i>Mr. Robot</i>. The show was a psychological thriller with Malek playing a computer hacker named Elliot. He won an Emmy for Best Lead Actor for the role. For the show's last season, Malek made $1 million per episode, but from his first big paycheck, the actor paid off his student loan, as stated by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">GQ</a>. His performance in <i>Mr. Robot</i> earned him much praise from critics and fellow actors. It has also led Malek to transform himself for the role of a lifetime.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=awards-galore-and-a-bright-future>Awards Galore And A Bright Future</h2><p>Rami Malek landed prominent roles in movies, but it wasn’t until 2019 that he became Hollywood’s leading man. While a film based on the legendary British band Queen had been in the works since 2010, many cast and production team changes occurred until 2016. Rami Malek snagged the role of the lead Freddie Mercury that year and began training to transform himself. As mentioned by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>, Malek inserted fake teeth to perfect Mercury’s voice and practiced with a choreographer to learn the unique moves. His impressive performance made the <a href=#>movie </a><a href=#><i>Bohemian Rhapsody</i></a><a href=#> a worldwide success</a> after its release in 2018.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The actor did a clean sweep during the award season in 2019, winning the BAFTA, Golden Globe, SAG, and Oscar for Best Lead Actor for <i>Bohemian Rhapsody</i>. Since his big win, Rami Malek has become a famous face at fashion shows and award ceremonies and has even received notable roles in movies. He lent his voice to <i>Dolittle</i> and portrayed the role of villain Lyutsifer Safin for Daniel Craig’s last adventure as James Bond in <i>No Time To Die</i> in 2021.</p><p>Rami Malek has climbed the ladder of success through his hard work and passion for becoming an actor. There was a time when he made small appearances in shows, and now he has become a recipient of many honorable awards. The actor was last seen starring in a supporting role in <i>Amsterdam in</i> 2022 and will be next seen in Christopher Nolan’s highly-anticipated 2023 film <i>Oppenheimer</i>.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>The Incredible Star Cast Of 'Amsterdam', Ranked By Net Worth</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Collider</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">GQ</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTBqbGMq5imoV2irq2xymaqraeirnqpu9Zmq6GdXZe8qbHMopinZaKdrrG%2Fzp2wZpmTqbyzecGempqllWKubrTOpaOyr5%2BksW6tjKWgrKyVp3w%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthe-rami-malek-story-how-the-bohemian-rhapsody-actor-became-a-hollywood-a-lister.html&text=The%20Rami%20Malek%20Story%3a%20How%20The%20%27Bohemian%20Rhapsody%27%20Actor%20Became%20A%20Hollywood%20A-Lister&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-rami-malek-story-how-the-bohemian-rhapsody-actor-became-a-hollywood-a-lister.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-rami-malek-story-how-the-bohemian-rhapsody-actor-became-a-hollywood-a-lister.html&title=The%20Rami%20Malek%20Story%3a%20How%20The%20%27Bohemian%20Rhapsody%27%20Actor%20Became%20A%20Hollywood%20A-Lister" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthe-rami-malek-story-how-the-bohemian-rhapsody-actor-became-a-hollywood-a-lister.html&title=The%20Rami%20Malek%20Story%3a%20How%20The%20%27Bohemian%20Rhapsody%27%20Actor%20Became%20A%20Hollywood%20A-Lister" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthe-rami-malek-story-how-the-bohemian-rhapsody-actor-became-a-hollywood-a-lister.html&title=The%20Rami%20Malek%20Story%3a%20How%20The%20%27Bohemian%20Rhapsody%27%20Actor%20Became%20A%20Hollywood%20A-Lister" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-rami-malek-story-how-the-bohemian-rhapsody-actor-became-a-hollywood-a-lister.html&description=The%20Rami%20Malek%20Story%3a%20How%20The%20%27Bohemian%20Rhapsody%27%20Actor%20Became%20A%20Hollywood%20A-Lister" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-corinne-foxx-mother-height-net-worth-boyfriend-509592-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Corinne Foxx?
