Not only do the Kardashians and Jenners hire people to clean their homes and cook their food, but they also have stylists, makeup artists, wig experts, and more on hand to help them curate their picture-perfect social media images.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There are also countless assistants who manage the family members' daily affairs, with everything from picking up dry cleaning to entertaining the kids for a bit. There are also nannies, of course, for the family's children, personal trainers for everyone, and security personnel.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Paris Hilton Angrily Stormed Out Of An ABC Interview With Dan Harris After He Claimed Kim Kardashian Had Become More Famous Than Her</a></span></p><p>It's not exactly clear how many people are employed by the Kar-Jenner empire, but it may well be in the hundreds—and that's only counting their home and household staff, not the people who work for brands like Kourtney's Poosh or Kim's SKIMS.</p><p>So how do they find all these people—and make sure they're trustworthy? It's an involved process that often ends in employees being fired, as fans have seen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But one of the ways that Kylie, in particular, has found many of her employees is through social media. Many of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">people who work for the Kardashians</a> connected with Kylie online.</p><p>Kylie may not always be behind the smartphone in terms of her social media activity, she did reach out to numerous rising-star personalities to connect on projects. For example, Kylie tracked down stylist-to-celebs Tokyo Stylez on Instagram, and the two have worked together since 2015.</p><p>Kylie's makeup artist is also a mega-personality; Ariel Tejada connected with Kylie in 2015 and has been by her side ever since.</p><h2 id=kim-kardashian-39-s-ex-assistant-steph-shepherd-is-still-friends-with-her>Kim Kardashian's Ex-Assistant Steph Shepherd Is Still Friends With Her</h2><p>As for Kim Kardashian's relationship with her employees, she's known to be a pretty decent boss.

That could have been the reason why <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shepherd felt "unfulfilled" in her gig</a> as Kim's assistant and, later, the Chief Operating Officer of Kardashian West Brands.</p><p>While it's assumed Shepherd received a raise to go along with her title change after four years of working with the Kardashians, it's still unclear whether money was part of Steph's decision to make a career shift.</p><h2 id=are-the-kardashians-nice-in-real-life-apparently-they-can-be>Are The Kardashians Nice In Real Life? Apparently, They Can Be</h2><p>The Kardashian-Jenner family has quite a reputation, and it's not always positive. Kim Kardashian has been called tone-deaf in the past, especially for her comments about working hard, and the other siblings have been similarly dragged as well.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>KUWTK May Not Have Existed If This Reality Show Hadn't Been Canceled</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A <a href=#>former employee of Khloé's even said she was a "nightmare" to work with</a> after he sustained an injury and was off work for a while.

He later sued Kardashian after being fired.</p><p>One bad review may not mean much to Khloé, however, given that she has just as many personal staff as the rest of her family.</p><h2 id=can-the-average-person-work-for-the-kardashians>Can The Average Person Work For The Kardashians?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/khloe-kardashian-in-a-crowd-of-fans-flanked-by-security.jpg><p>For fans wondering how to work for the Kardashians, it isn't exactly easy to land a gig—at least, not a high-paying one.</p><p>The <a href=#>Kardashians have been known to hire unpaid interns</a> to work at and around their homes in Los Angeles.

After all, as social media queens, the Kar-Jenners are likely looking for experts who know the industry and how things work behind the scenes.</p><p>The good news is, it doesn't sound like the family holds interviews, so a solid social media following and a useful fashion, makeup, or hair talent could be all fans need to get hired.
