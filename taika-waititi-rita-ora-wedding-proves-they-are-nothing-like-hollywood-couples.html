After all, they love to report on stars like <a href=#>Nicolas Cage whose marriage only lasted days</a> or juicy stories like <a href=#>Matt LeBlanc refusing to attend Jennifer Aniston and Brad Pitt's wedding</a>. On top of that, the media loves to report on celebrities who spend a fortune on their nuptials.</p><p>When <a href=#>Rita Ora got banned from Gordon Ramsay's restaurant</a>, the media loved reporting on that accurately. However, when Ora and Taika Waititi walked down the aisle, many reports turned out to be wrong. Ora and Waititi later revealed the truth about their oddball wedding.</p><h2 id=inside-taika-waititi-and-rita-ora-39-s-wedding>Inside Taika Waititi And Rita Ora's Wedding</h2><p>In 2020, Marie Claire put together a list of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">celebrity weddings that cost a staggering amount of money</a>.

As did Kim Kardashian and Kris Humphries' nuptials. Marie Claire also reported that Justin Timberlake and Jessica Biel paid $6.5 million for their wedding.</p><p>Given those figures, some people may have assumed Taika Waititi and Rita Ora paid millions on their wedding. Failing that, it certainly seems like the celebrity couple must have spent hundreds of thousands at least.</p><p>In 2023, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Waititi and Ora spoke to Vogue about the day they got married</a> in 2022. Based on what the couple told Vogue, reports and commonly held beliefs about their wedding were wrong.

As Vogue's piece described, Waititi and Ora spent very little time putting together the plans for their big day.</p><p>"As far as the planning process goes, there wasn’t one: The entire event was dreamed up and executed in just two weeks." Given how quickly their wedding was put together, it makes sense that Ora and Waititi's ceremony was remarkably simple.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/taika-waititi-and-rita-ora-looking-happy-together.jpg><p>Waititi explained to Vogue that he and Ora didn't fly around the world to their wedding destination. “It wasn’t in London or in France like everyone reported. It was in L.A. with a small group of friends.” Ora then went on to clarify exactly where they tied the knot. "At our home."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After Waititi went on to joke about giving out their address, he later explained how few people attended their wedding.</p><p>“There were about eight people there—just close friends and family, and parents on Zoom.”</p><p>Ora explained Waititi's comments further by naming one of the people who played a key role in their day. “It was really us and my sister, Elena.

As a part of Waititi's comments, he further outlined many typical elements of weddings that he and Ora didn't bother with.</p><p>“Yeah, it was beautiful. Just having close friends and not having it too big. We didn’t have table settings or any of the stressful things that go along with weddings, and it was nice to just have it super-simple. My daughters were there, and they made everything really fun and easy: I think just because we didn’t have the pressure of having caterers and all of these things, you know, people turning up late, and all of the different moving parts.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/taika-waititi-and-rita-ora-looking-at-each-other.jpg><p>Following up on her husband's comments, Ora revealed that they also didn't have a typical wedding reception. Instead, Waititi and Ora were joined by their guests for a simple dinner party held at the home of their friend Guy Oseary.</p><p>“He was so kind to host us at the last minute. We got a group of people together, and we just had a great time!” Vogue's article also revealed that the dinner party had a surprise guest.
