Fans were delighted to hear about the fact that there was going to be a biopic that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">talks about her life </a>and puts forward the story of this incredible musical sensation. However, it's fair to say that fans expected it to follow the same guidelines and patterns that most other biopics do.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This one, for some reason, has been designed very differently. It tells <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the tale of Celine's life,</a> but it doesn't actually speak of her directly. This particular biopic was designed to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">loosely parallel her life,</a> and as Smooth Radio reports, it actually features and develops the plot line around a fictional character.</p><h2 id=why-was-the-title-changed><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Why Was The Title Changed?</span></h2><p>Fans are baffled about the name change that was involved with this particular biopic. They were first introduced to the concept of this biopic, and it was referenced as being called The Power Of Love. Using the direct title of one of Celine Dion's biggest hits seemed to be very fitting, and it instantly resonated with her fans.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Just as fans began to warm up to that title and get excited about things to come, the name was changed to Aline. That is the name of the fictional character that depicts Celine in the biopic, played by Valerie Lemercier. This new title doesn't connect with fans on any level and is likely a change required due to licensing and rights issues.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans Are Concerned That Celine Dion Is Too Skinny</a></span></p><h2 id=why-doesn-t-the-biopic-even-mention-celine-s-name><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Why Doesn't The Biopic Even Mention Celine's Name?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even more bizarre than the name change itself, is the fact that there is now an entire biopic dedicated to the incredible life and times of Celine Dion, yet mysteriously, her&nbsp; name is not even mentioned a single time. The entire biopic begins and ends with Aline and completely avoids using and uttering the name Celine in any capacity. In fact, if fans aren't already loosely familiar with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celine Dion's life story,</a> they wouldn't precisely know what this is a biopic about her at all. Her name doesn't even surface once, in spite of the fact that this biopic was created about her.</p><h2 id=why-is-there-no-mention-of-her-heritage><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Why Is There No Mention Of Her Heritage?</span></h2><p>Celine Dion is a proud French Canadian. She has a deep-rooted heritage that she carried&nbsp; with her and was prominently displayed through her French language music over the span of her career. She often spoke of her roots, her family, and the fact that she came from a very modest French Canadian home.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Her heritage was entirely left out of this biopic, and there wasn't a single reference point which touched on her French Canadian upbringing. Even those who know very little about Celine Dion are aware of the fact that much of her identity revolves around French culture, and fans want to know why this was entirely left out of her biopic.</p><h2 id=did-something-go-wrong-behind-the-scenes><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Did Something Go Wrong Behind The Scenes?</span></h2><p>Most biopics are official declarations of a star's life. They tell an accurate tale and are jam packed with factual information and deep dives into the most critically important aspects of a celebrity's life. Fans are wanting to know if something went wrong behind-the-scenes with the making of this biopic, as it is so loosely based on Celine Dion's life that it often strays from the factual path that is intended to follow. Refinery 29 indicates that this biopic <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">barely serves as merely a semi-official depiction of her life and career</a>, leaving fans questioning if something went seriously wrong with the agreements made for production.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celine Dion Pays Homage To The Impact Jim Steinman Had On Her Career</a></span></p><h2 id=what-s-with-the-broken-connection><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>What's With The Broken Connection?</span></h2><p>Fans that wanted to immerse themselves in the life and times of Celine Dion and truly wanted to experience all the "feels" that come along with her journey, are likely to be disappointed. There's such a broken connection between Aline and Celine, and fans want to know why this clear divide between the character and the subject was created.</p><p>The hope was that there would be fluidity and connectivity between the person playing the role of Celine and her actual real-life story. Instead, Celine Dion's songs are featured, but the artist is referred to as "Aline" instead, and fans are left both confused and disappointed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celine Dion Posts Heartbreaking Tribute To Her Late Husband</a></span></p><h2 id=is-this-actually-a-biopic><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Is This Actually A Biopic?</span></h2><p>One of the biggest questions fans have about this biopic is whether or not it can even be classified as a biopic at all. The producers themselves have referenced this as being more of an "homage" than an actual biopic, and that seems to be the way it reads and feels. Details such as Celine's name being "Aline" and René Angélil&nbsp;being named Guy-Claude Kamar are concerning to fans who were seeking accuracy. Fans are aware that Celine Dion authorized the production of this biopic, but they aren't sure it meets the criteria of being one at all.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-did-celine-dion-ever-approve-this><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>How Did Celine Dion Ever Approve This?</span></h2><p>Sadly, this biopic is missing the mark with many Celine Dion fans who have followed her life and career and have been part of her many ups and downs. Those who are passionately connected to the artist and have invested many years following along and being part of her life as she shared it with them online, on stage, and through her music, simply cannot believe the inaccuracies and issues surrounding this biopic. In fact, social media is riddled with people that want to know how Celine ever approved this and why.</p><h2 id=what-is-the-point-of-this><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>What Is The Point Of This?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>What is the point of a biopic that confuses more than it informs? What's the point of having a biopic that doesn't reference the subject's name and doesn't depict their story full of truths, but rather tells a story like a fairy tale or other fiction novel would? Fans just don't get it, and they're being vocal about asking what the point of this biopic even is.</p><p>It's not serving the purpose or satiating the appetites of those who wanted to learn more about their favorite star. Instead, they're left with more questions than answers, and a film that doesn't capture the true essence of the legend it depicts.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celine Dion Vs Madonna: Who Has A Higher Net Worth?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGicr52irsGptc2gZJ%2BZnqh6or7EZqiunaOptrC6yKeeZpmSpMK1ecKeo6KmlWKxqrvNrGSboZ%2BltqR5wKWgp51f</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2feverything-fans-are-questioning-about-celine-dions-biopic-aline.html&text=Everything%20Fans%20Are%20Questioning%20About%20Celine%20Dion%27s%20Biopic%20%27Aline%27&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2feverything-fans-are-questioning-about-celine-dions-biopic-aline.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2feverything-fans-are-questioning-about-celine-dions-biopic-aline.html&title=Everything%20Fans%20Are%20Questioning%20About%20Celine%20Dion%27s%20Biopic%20%27Aline%27" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2feverything-fans-are-questioning-about-celine-dions-biopic-aline.html&title=Everything%20Fans%20Are%20Questioning%20About%20Celine%20Dion%27s%20Biopic%20%27Aline%27" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2feverything-fans-are-questioning-about-celine-dions-biopic-aline.html&title=Everything%20Fans%20Are%20Questioning%20About%20Celine%20Dion%27s%20Biopic%20%27Aline%27" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2feverything-fans-are-questioning-about-celine-dions-biopic-aline.html&description=Everything%20Fans%20Are%20Questioning%20About%20Celine%20Dion%27s%20Biopic%20%27Aline%27" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./cardinal-fixed-mutable-signs.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is your Zodiac sign cardinal, fixed or mutable?
