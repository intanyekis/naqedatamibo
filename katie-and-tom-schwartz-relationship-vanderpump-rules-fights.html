The couple, who had been together for more than 12 years, announced their separation in March via Instagram, shocking fans. The reality tv star's divorce has officially been finalized as of October 2022.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Vanderpump Rules: 10 Things Fans Didn't Know About Katie & Tom's Relationship</a></span></p><p>While some fans were shocked, others saw the couple's divorce coming. Even as the longest-lasting couple in the reality show's history, fans had difficulty rooting for the couple. They felt the couple was more toxic together than good for each other. For years the pair's intense arguments have been documented on <a href=#>Vander</a>p<a href=#>ump Rules</a>. Here are some of the most brutal moments the couple shared on screen.</p><h2 id=tom-schwartz-and-katie-maloney-fought-before-their-wedding><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Tom Schwartz And Katie Maloney Fought Before Their Wedding</span></h2><p>Being stressed about planning a wedding is reasonable, but the stress went more profound with the couple. It was hard to watch Katie and Tom fighting before their wedding. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Their bickering was relentless</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During season five, we watched as the two fought over the simplest things. It became cringeworthy and made fans question whether or not the two would walk down the aisle after all. They didn't leave their officiant Lisa Vanderpump waiting, though. The couple managed to pull their act together for their wedding day.</p><h2 id=tom-schwartz-admitted-to-cheating-on-katie><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Tom Schwartz Admitted To Cheating On Katie</span></h2><p>It seemed like things could be over for Katie and Tom when it was revealed that Tom cheated. While it was one of the less intense cheating incidents on the show, Tom had lied to Katie repeatedly about the incident. When the truth finally came out, Katie was devastated. Tom had made out with not one but two different women.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Shock Split: Vanderpump Rules Stars Call Off Engagement After 5 Years Together</a></span></p><p>It was a struggle for the couple to repair the broken trust and one of the more brutal moments to watch them go through. While they claimed to have gotten over the incident, it's hard not to assume that Katie took Tom's previous wrong actions into account when contemplating their divorce.</p><h2 id=tom-39-s-close-relationship-with-tom-sandoval-caused-many-fights><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Tom's Close Relationship With Tom Sandoval Caused Many Fights</span></h2><p>One of the driving factors in Katie and Tom growing apart was Tom's relationship with Tom Sandoval. The pair have been inseparable since the beginning of Vanderpump Rules. They are co-owners and the namesakes of Lisa Vanderpump's LA hot spot TomTom. As the Tom's business endeavors continued, the amount of time Tom chose to dedicate to his marriage dwindled. Katie was open about feeling unwanted and unacknowledged by her partner, but</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tequila-katie-39-s-wrath-was-hard-to-watch><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Tequila Katie's Wrath Was Hard To Watch</span></h2><p>Fans of Vanderpump Rules know all about Tequila Katie. If there's one thing she can do well, it's wreaking havoc. It was funny to watch Katie let loose every now and again, but fans soon saw how dark the reality tv star could get when she indulged a little too much.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Which 'Vanderpump Rules' Cast Member Wins The Popularity Contest On Instagram?</a></span></p><p>Tom and Tequila Katie's fights were excruciating to watch. Katie would say anything and everything that was irking her about Tom, cutting deep. Most of Tequila Katie's outbursts were directed at Tom. Watching the couple tear each other down wasn't fun, and it undoubtedly couldn't have helped strengthen their relationship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=katie-and-tom-struggled-with-intimacy-throughout-their-relationship><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Katie And Tom Struggled With Intimacy Throughout Their Relationship</span></h2><p>One thing Katie and Tom weren't afraid to talk about was their time in the bedroom - or lack thereof. The two were honest about their lackluster intimate life on Vanderpump Rules. While intimacy isn't everything, it further proved how far apart the two were. They seemed content being roommates. Their cast mates were also eager to poke fun at the couple for the lack of intimacy in their relationship.</p><h2 id=katie-and-tom-will-continue-fighting-on-season-10-of-vanderpump-rules><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Katie And Tom Will Continue Fighting On Season 10 Of Vanderpump Rules</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Season 10 of Vanderpump Rules will offer viewers front-row seats to the aftermath of Katie and Tom's relationship. The couple has already been captured by paparazzi fighting with camera crews in tow. While we don't know all the details, viewers can bet to see some sparks fly between the two while they deal with the aftermath of their relationship.</p><p>People are intrigued to see how the dynamics of the group change and, more importantly, which the two date next. Word has broken out that Tom and cast mate Raquel Leviss hooked up, outraging some and exciting other fans. This comes on the heels of <a href=#>her breakup with another Vanderpump Rules star, DJ James Kennedy</a>.</p><p>Whatever love there was between Katie and Raquel is long gone, though. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Katie was seen commenting on a picture of Raquel donning a TomTom sweatshirt</a>, saying that "she's a fan girl, she started off as a fan of the show, and now she's a fan of the toms."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's predicted that the outcome of the girls' relationship will be depicted in the upcoming season of Vanderpump Rules. Fans will have to wait until then to get the inside scoop about what's really going on between Tom, Raquel, and Katie's feelings on it all.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiimqyZmnqiusNmq6ilXaiwqcPAq6uzZaKauaLAyKilrKCZpXq3rc2dnKuopaK9br7UpZysZZaetKnA0mg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fkatie-and-tom-schwartz-relationship-vanderpump-rules-fights.html&text=Katie%20Maloney%20And%20Tom%20Schwartzs%20Relationship%20Moments%20On%20Vanderpump%20Rules%20Are%20Downright%20Intense&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fkatie-and-tom-schwartz-relationship-vanderpump-rules-fights.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fkatie-and-tom-schwartz-relationship-vanderpump-rules-fights.html&title=Katie%20Maloney%20And%20Tom%20Schwartzs%20Relationship%20Moments%20On%20Vanderpump%20Rules%20Are%20Downright%20Intense" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fkatie-and-tom-schwartz-relationship-vanderpump-rules-fights.html&title=Katie%20Maloney%20And%20Tom%20Schwartzs%20Relationship%20Moments%20On%20Vanderpump%20Rules%20Are%20Downright%20Intense" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fkatie-and-tom-schwartz-relationship-vanderpump-rules-fights.html&title=Katie%20Maloney%20And%20Tom%20Schwartzs%20Relationship%20Moments%20On%20Vanderpump%20Rules%20Are%20Downright%20Intense" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fkatie-and-tom-schwartz-relationship-vanderpump-rules-fights.html&description=Katie%20Maloney%20And%20Tom%20Schwartzs%20Relationship%20Moments%20On%20Vanderpump%20Rules%20Are%20Downright%20Intense" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./shemar-moore.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Shemar Moore Celebrity Profile  Hollywood Life">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./kathleen-mccrone-biogrraphy-net-worth-age-sister-and-daughter-of-wayne-newtons-wife-2.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kathleen McCrone Biogrraphy; Net Worth, Age, Sister And Daughter Of Wayne Newtons Wife">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
