While the glitz and glamour of a final production might suggest a smooth filming process, there are often quite a few bumps in the road. And sometimes, those bumps can be the mega-stars themselves.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Actors Who Hate The Roles That Made Them Rich</a></span></p><p>Indeed, there are more than a few well-known actors that not only created disruptions on set but were fired for those disruptions. Some of those situations were widely publicized, while some were kept in the down-low in the public eye. Here’s a list of 10 well-known and notoriously impossible-to-work-with celebrities who were fired during filming.</p><h2 id=charlie-sheen-two-and-a-half-men>Charlie Sheen ('Two and a Half Men')</h2><p>Topping the list is the big winner—or maybe loser, in this case. Two and a Half Men star Charlie Sheen was dismissed mid-season from one of the most popular comedy shows on CBS, for exhibiting “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">dangerously self-destructive conduct</a>,” and allegedly calling the producer and co-creator Chuck Lorre a “clown” and a “stupid, stupid little man.”</p><p>Sheen is likely more widely known for his public appearances that followed his termination: a series of manic TV and radio interviews, insisting that he’s a “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">winner</a>” and that he has “tiger blood” driving his success.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=richard-gere-the-lords-of-the-flatbush>Richard Gere ('The Lords of the Flatbush')</h2><p>This celebrity is notorious for his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">famous feud</a> with Sylvestor Stallone, while on set to star in the 1974 film, The Lords of the Flatbush. It could have been Gere’s first big break—if his tussles with Stallone&nbsp;hadn't ended it for him instead.</p><p>According to Sylvester—who opened up about the celebrity drama during <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an interview</a> with Ain’t it Cool—the incident that tipped the scales happened during a lunch break, during which Gere reportedly “[strutted] around in his oversized motorcycle jacket” and dropped a particularly greasy piece of chicken on Stallone’s pants.&nbsp;After that final straw, Gere was terminated from&nbsp;the cast, and Perry King took his place.</p><h2 id=isaiah-washington-grey-s-anatomy>Isaiah Washington ('Grey’s Anatomy')</h2><p>Dr. Preston Burke was a favorite face in the medical drama <a href=#>Grey’s Anatomy</a>—that is, at least, until he was&nbsp;cut quite abruptly out of the show’s main story. Isaiah Washington was terminated on-set in 2007, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">after using a homophobic slur</a> in reference to T.R. Knight (George O’Malley).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>His character returned to Grey’s seven years later, sparking <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">enormous controversy</a> for the network. Whether or not his reappearance was worth the public relations nightmare is debatable, but this celebrity got his second chance on one of the most revered dramas on television.</p><h2 id=maggie-roswell-the-simpsons>Maggie Roswell ('The Simpsons')</h2><p>Her face might not be so familiar, but you’d likely recognize her voice: Maggie Roswell, the actress behind The Simpsons&nbsp;character, Maude Flanders. While the Fox celebrity maintained <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">in an interview</a> that she was fired for asking for a raise, the show’s producers tell a different story.</p><p>According to Fox executives, the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">voice actress</a>&nbsp;stepped out because “she no longer wanted to commute to Los Angeles from her Denver home.” After her request for a raise, Fox boosted her $2,000-per-episode rate with a measly stipend of $125. Roswell found the “raise” insulting and left the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=dominic-monaghan-lost>Dominic Monaghan ('Lost')</h2><p>In an interview, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dominic Monaghan shared his thoughts</a> on his character, Charlie Pace, getting killed off during Lost’s season 3 finale. He didn’t put up a fight over leaving the show, admitting his difficult-to-deal-with behavior on set.</p><p>But there was more drama that tipped the boat. Apparently, after his romance with co-star Evangeline Lilly (Kate Austen) ended, Monaghan was bitter. He was provocative on set and shared some <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">hefty allegations</a> about co-star Matthew Fox on Twitter. Likely, the cast and crew weren’t too upset Monaghan was forced to leave the island.</p><h2 id=shannen-doherty-beverly-hills-90210>Shannen Doherty ('Beverly Hills 90210')</h2><p>A 90’s favorite, Beverly Hills 90210 was full of <a href=#>attitude</a> and drama, apparently both on and off-camera. Shannen Doherty was notorious for her altercations on-set, constantly picking fights with the cast. Tori Spelling, Doherty’s co-star and daughter of the show’s producer, revealed the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">extent of the drama</a>. She admitted she played a role in Doherty’s removal, ultimately asking her father, Aaron Spelling, to terminate Doherty’s contract.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Top 10 Richest Actors&nbsp;in the World of 2019</a></span></p><p>Doherty carried&nbsp;her inflammatory behavior into her other roles, famously bickering with co-star Alyssa Milano in the 1998 series, Charmed—which led to another bad-blood-induced dismissal.</p><h2 id=taylor-momsen-gossip-girl>Taylor Momsen ('Gossip Girl')</h2><p>After four seasons of appearing in the hit series Gossip Gir<a href=#>l</a>, it was announced that 17-year-old Taylor Momsen would take an "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">indefinite hiatus</a>" from the show. Momsen—who first appeared on screen at age 7—was known for her foul mouth and provocative antics well before Gossip Girl first debuted.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">A source explained</a> to Us Magazine how Momsen only did the show for the money, “[treating] it like a 9-5 [with] no emotional investment.” Enduring season after season of her “unreliable and <a href=#>erratic</a> behavior,” the producers decided to cut her from the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=thomas-gibson-criminal-minds>Thomas Gibson ('Criminal Minds')</h2><p>Gibson, the head “Hotch” of the Criminal Minds team, was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fired in 2016</a> after a fight broke out on set. During the altercation, the star of the CBS drama allegedly kicked Virgil Williams, a producer of the show, over a disputed line in the script.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Criminal Minds: Net Worth of the Cast, Past, And Present</a></span></p><p>Gibson’s violent behavior wasn’t news to the cast. A similar physical outburst occurred between himself and the assistant director in 2010—resulting in a foul&nbsp;reputation and a series of anger management classes.&nbsp;His inflammatory behavior and his history with alcohol&nbsp;led to Gibson’s ultimate termination.</p><h2 id=james-remar-aliens>James Remar ('Aliens')</h2><p>He’s known for most of his supporting roles in films and TV shows—think Dexter and Sex and the City. James Remar was finally set to play in a starring role, as Corporal Hicks in the film Aliens, but was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">replaced by Michael Biehn</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>His termination was not without reason. At the time, it was publically announced that Remar left for “creative differences” between himself and filmmaker James Cameron. However, it was later revealed that his dismissal was due to his possession of drugs throughout the filming process.</p><h2 id=judy-garland-valley-of-the-dolls>Judy Garland ('Valley of the Dolls')</h2><p>This ruby-heeled icon takes us home, bringing us to the end of our list. Garland, known for her role in The Wizard of Oz, was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">infamously cast and then fired</a> from the 1967 production of Valley of the Dolls, over issues of reliability on-set.</p><p>According to Patty Duke, who played Neely O’Hara in the film, Garland was “charming and funny… but she was having a problem with alcohol.” After refusing to come out of her dressing room during one particular incident, Garland was fired—dismissed to go, well, <a href=#>home sweet home</a>.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>10 Notoriously Difficult Actors Who Have Stormed Off Set</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmqaegYrC2uNOuqZ5nmaK9sL%2FSopmlnV2pvG7DzquiZq%2BZqbVusMifnaKbpaHBbq%2FRmrGyZZOauaau0aKrop2jYsC1rdGsZJ%2BhopqxbrDUq6Cnn12btq25yKeeaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fimpossible-to-work-with-difficult-crazy-celebrities-stars-fired-during-filming.html&text=10%20Impossible-To-Work-With%20Celebrities%20Fired%20During%20Filming&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fimpossible-to-work-with-difficult-crazy-celebrities-stars-fired-during-filming.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fimpossible-to-work-with-difficult-crazy-celebrities-stars-fired-during-filming.html&title=10%20Impossible-To-Work-With%20Celebrities%20Fired%20During%20Filming" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fimpossible-to-work-with-difficult-crazy-celebrities-stars-fired-during-filming.html&title=10%20Impossible-To-Work-With%20Celebrities%20Fired%20During%20Filming" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fimpossible-to-work-with-difficult-crazy-celebrities-stars-fired-during-filming.html&title=10%20Impossible-To-Work-With%20Celebrities%20Fired%20During%20Filming" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fimpossible-to-work-with-difficult-crazy-celebrities-stars-fired-during-filming.html&description=10%20Impossible-To-Work-With%20Celebrities%20Fired%20During%20Filming" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./bad-birdie-golf-shirts-shark-tank.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Bad Birdie Golf Shirts  Shark Tank Update">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./zaful-sweater-twist-fall-fashion-strappy-amazon.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="ZAFUL Sweater Puts a Twist on Your Favorite Slouchy Styles">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
