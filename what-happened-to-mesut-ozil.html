He told his fans that the surgery went well.</p><p style=color:#252525>He posted a picture of himself in his hospital bed with a thumbs-up and the words “Today’s Surgery Went Well” on Instagram. Thanks again to everyone for their messages and prayers. May God bless you all!’</p><p style=color:#252525>He said before the surgery that he would be out of action for a while because of the recovery time, but he is determined to play football as soon as he can.</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=noopener>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel=noopener>A post shared by Mesut Özil (@m10_official)</a></p><h2><strong>Why Is Ozil No Longer Playing For Germany?</strong></h2><p style=color:#252525>Even though Mesut Ozil was a key figure in one of Germany’s most successful generations, his international career ended in conflict instead of praise. Since then, the winner of the World Cup has not said anything about the situation—until now.</p><p style=color:#252525>In an interview with The Athletic, the World Cup winner defended his controversial photo with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and talked about his decision for the first time since his explosive and strongly worded retirement announcement.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/mesut-ozilpic-with-turkey-1-1024x576.jpg alt="mesut ozilpic with turkey" width=1024 height=576 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p style=color:#252525>“Now that I’ve had time to think about it, I know it was the right choice,” said the 31-year-old. “It was a very hard time for me because I played for Germany for nine years and was one of their best players. I won the World Cup and more, played a lot of games—many of them really well—and gave everything I had.</p><p style=color:#252525>Zil’s name was one of the first, if not the first, on Germany’s team sheet for a long time. But the German Football Bund made the midfielder feel “disrespected and unprotected” after he took a bad picture with Erdogan before the disastrous 2018 Fifa World Cup in Russia (DFB).</p><p style=color:#252525>“I was getting racist comments from politicians and other public figures, but no one from the national team came out and told them to stop.” This is our player, and you can’t insult him like that. Everyone just stayed quiet and let it happen.</p><h2><strong>Why Did Ozil Leave International Football?</strong></h2><p style=color:#252525>After being blamed for his country’s poor World Cup performance, the Arsenal attacker has ended his international career.</p><p style=color:#252525>Just a few days after Germany was embarrassed at the World Cup, DFB President Reinhard Grindel asked Mesut Ozil to talk about his meeting with Turkey President Recep Tayyip Erdogan before the tournament.</p><p style=color:#252525>Grindel got exactly what he asked for. But it wasn’t what he expected or hoped for from the 93-time Germany International.</p><p style=color:#252525>Ozil Meticulously Described His Meeting With Erdogan, Then Launched A Scathing Attack On Griefel And His Supporters Before Confirming His International Retirement In A Lengthy Three-Part Statement Released Section By Section Throughout The Day.</p><p>The statement was powerful and thought-provoking, and it explained why the 29-year-old took so long to respond to his treatment following Germany’s World Cup exit.</p><p>Germany had failed to advance from their group for the first time in 80 years, but instead of blaming Head Coach.</p><p><strong>Read More</strong></p><ul><li style=color:#252525><a href=#>Les Dawson Comedian & Actor, Died At The Age Of 62: What’s The Cause Of His Death And Know More About His Wife And Children!</a></li><li><a href=#>Judith Durham Of The Seekers, An Australian Folk Singer, Died At The Age Of 79</a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwtr7RnqWtZZ%2Bjuaq6xGeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2xX6y1osCMoZipqJWjsqV506hkpp2jqsFuu9mio2hsY2h%2Fc3s%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-mesut-ozil.html&text=What%20Happened%20To%20Mesut%20Ozil%3f%20Why%20Is%20Ozil%20No%20Longer%20Playing%20For%20Germany%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-happened-to-mesut-ozil.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-mesut-ozil.html&title=What%20Happened%20To%20Mesut%20Ozil%3f%20Why%20Is%20Ozil%20No%20Longer%20Playing%20For%20Germany%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-mesut-ozil.html&title=What%20Happened%20To%20Mesut%20Ozil%3f%20Why%20Is%20Ozil%20No%20Longer%20Playing%20For%20Germany%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-mesut-ozil.html&title=What%20Happened%20To%20Mesut%20Ozil%3f%20Why%20Is%20Ozil%20No%20Longer%20Playing%20For%20Germany%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-mesut-ozil.html&description=What%20Happened%20To%20Mesut%20Ozil%3f%20Why%20Is%20Ozil%20No%20Longer%20Playing%20For%20Germany%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./5-fascinating-facts-about-john-d-rockefeller.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="5 Fascinating Facts about John D.
