First, let me remind you it’s one of the best things Marvel has ever done. Second, the amazing intro had me thinking 1) how Westworld stole its theme and, 2) that I should rank the best TV/show intros. I started listing them, but then realized I need two lists — live action and animated — because I can easily list over 30 combined. This week is the live action list; next week, we’ll rank the animated ones.</p><h3><strong>Best Show Intros</strong></h3><li>Game of Thrones — Greatest combination of music and graphic design… ever? Side note: the Pirates using it with their lineups was tremendously done.</li><li>Friends — I’ll be there for you!</li><li>Daredevil — What kicked this all off — the gravitas of the music</li><li>Fresh Prince — You’re singing it right now. Kind of a music video.</li><li>X-Files — One of the most iconic instrumental songs of all TV history.</li><li>Westworld — Even stealing Daredevil’s style, it’s a great one</li><li>Sopranos — Even not having watched the entire series, I know how great the intro is.</li><li>Golden Girls — One of the most iconic ones of all time (and the wife’s favorite).</li><li>Peacemaker — Easily the most insane one on the list.</li><li>The Office — You get a sense of every character’s traits just from a quick shot through this fun intro.</li><li>Knight Rider — That song, and voice.</li><li>MacGyver — These 80s shows had some of the best intro music and clip segments ever (also kinda sounds like Chip N Dale to start).</li><li>A-Team — Along the Knight Rider older shows I watched reruns of while home sick, another great one.</li><li>Full House — Maybe showing my age a bit, but I can’t think of any other show’s intro that embodies the 90s style than this.</li><li>Psych — I know, you know, that you should love this show and how fun the intro is.</li><li>The Brady Bunch — Who doesn’t know this song?</li><li>Saved by the Bell — “And the ‘larm gives out a warnin'” … in case you never figured out what the hell was being sung.</li><li>Airwolf — Knight Rider part two?</li><li>Community — Simple. Fun. Just like the paper fortune teller they use for the credits.</li><li>Stranger Things — Something about that eerie music keeps me from skipping the intro of only letters moving into place. (Loki too, just like this)</li><p>Honorable Mention: Adventures of Pete and Pete; CHiPs — Upbeat version of those 80s midday reruns.</p><p>Editors’ note: Yes, we also are assuming Jake has never seen the Dallas. Or Just the 10 of Us. Or In Living Color. Or Get A Life. Or ALF. Or The Munsters. Or…</p><p>Jake: Legit forgot about ALF — good call! Oh, and Cheers, but HM because I never watched it. Double oh!
