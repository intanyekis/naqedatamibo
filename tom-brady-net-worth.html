As the fourth child of Galynn and Thomas Brady, he is also the sole son. Nancy, Julie, and Maureen are his older sisters. His family was devout Catholics. He has fond childhood memories of going to 49ers games with his family.</p><p style=text-align:justify>He looked up to Joe Montana growing up. He has always been a huge supporter of the Lakers and Celtics. While attending football camp at the College of San Mateo, he learned the fundamentals of the game from future NFL quarterback Tony Graziani.</p><h2 id=tom-brady-net-worth class=rb-heading-index-0>Tom Brady Net Worth</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Tom Brady is a former American football quarterback, as well as a spokesperson and businessman. <strong>Tom Brady’s net worth is estimated to be $300 million.</strong> That’s not including his ex-wife, the supermodel Gisele Bundchen, who’s worth an estimated $400 million on her own. Together, Tom and Gisele were worth $650 million when they tied the knot.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Tom Brady has won seven Super Bowls, the most by any player in NFL history, and played in a record 10 Super Bowls with the New England Patriots and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

Starting in his second year, he set an NFL record by remaining with the Patriots for a total of 20 seasons as the team’s quarterback. In his first year as a starting quarterback, he won the Super Bowl, making him one of only two quarterbacks to do it. He never had a losing season as a starting quarterback for the Patriots, and he is the NFL’s all-time leader in victories at quarterback.</p><p style=text-align:justify>He is the most successful quarterback in NFL history, having guided the Patriots to 16 division championships. He has the best postseason record in NFL history, 30-11, and has made more playoff appearances than any other player. In the years since 2011, Brady has guided the Patriots to an NFL-record eight consecutive AFC title games. Brady has also set a new NFL record by being named to 14 Pro Bowls.</p><p style=text-align:justify>For his apparent role in the Deflategate football tampering scandal, Brady was suspended for the first four games of the 2016 season. Two of the next three Super Bowls were won by Brady and the Patriots.</p><h2 id=how-much-is-tom-brady8217s-twoyear-deal-with-tampa-bay-worth class=rb-heading-index-2>How Much Is Tom Brady’s Two-Year Deal with Tampa Bay Worth?</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Tom’s two-year deal with Tampa Bay is worth at least $50 million. His annual compensation will total $25 million ($15 million base salary + $10 million roster bonus). The maximum value of his deal is $60 million, contingent upon his achievement of certain goals. Tom rejected a larger offer from the Patriots because it did not include a completely guaranteed salary.</p>View this post on Instagram<p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none href=# rel=noopener>A post shared by Tom Brady (@tombrady)</a></p><h2 id=will-tom-brady8217s-commentary-career-impact-his-legacy-as-an-nfl-legend class=rb-heading-index-3>Will Tom Brady’s Commentary Career Impact His Legacy as an NFL Legend?</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Tom Brady reportedly inked a 10-year, $375 million deal with Fox Sports to commentate on NFL games after his playing career ended on May 10, 2022. With an annual salary of $37.5 million, Brady would earn slightly more than twice as much as former quarterbacks turned commentators Tony Romo and Troy Aikman.
