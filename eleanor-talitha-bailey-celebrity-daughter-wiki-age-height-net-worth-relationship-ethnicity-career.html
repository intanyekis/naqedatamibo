Eleanor was born in 2015 and comes from a family with connections to the entertainment business.</h3><h2 id=h0 class=wp-block-heading>How Old Is Eleanor Talitha Bailey? Age, Wiki, Family, Early Life</h2><p>In 2015, Eleanor Talitha Bailey was born. She was the second daughter of famous couple Devon Aoki and businessman James Bailey, born in the United States. Eleanor, who looks a lot like her model mother, appears to have inherited Devon’s alluring beauty, as seen in a photo that Aoki posted from when she was younger on Instagram.</p><p>In a similar vein, her uncle Steve Aoki is a well-known electronic DJ and her aunt Echo V. Aoki is a model. Steve Aoki was formerly married to Australian model Tiernan Cowling. Her grandpa Hiroaki Aoki, sometimes known as Rocky, was an amateur wrestler and restaurateur who immigrated to the United States.</p><p>Eleanor comes from a long line of varied backgrounds. Eleanor Hilburger’s grandmother, Pamela Hilburger, keeps a low profile despite her parents’ 1991 divorce. She also designed jewelry and painted, which was a reflection of her English and German heritage.</p><h2 id=h1 class=wp-block-heading>How many siblings does she have?</h2><p>Devon Aoki’s touching Instagram glimpses show that Eleanor Talitha Bailey comes from a well-knit family and has a close relationship with her brothers. Similarly, on June 10, 2011, her brother James Bailey Jr. was born, and on February 13, 2013, her sister Alessandra Linville was born.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.favebites.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/22114035/devonaoki_1640430643_2736453028144273461_204547792.jpg><p>Before Evelyn, Eleanor’s younger sister, came, she relished being the youngest.</p><p>Together, the siblings, a dynamic quartet, have entered the modeling industry and graced the campaigns of prestigious brands such as Adidas and Gap. Devon’s social media also shows off special times when their personal relationship comes through, demonstrating their sincere intimacy and affection for one another.</p><h2 id=h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who Are Eleanor’s Parents Devon Aoki and James Bailey?</h2><p>Devon Aoki, who gained notoriety for her influential parts in films such as “Sin City” and “2 Fast 2 Furious,” consciously decided to give up acting. Her decision was motivated by a sincere desire to put her family first, particularly Eleanor Talitha Bailey and her other children.</p><p>Devon placed her successful acting career on wait to focus on raising her family, even though her ensemble performance earned her recognition and a nomination for a Critic Choice award.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.favebites.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/22114119/devonaoki_1638348743_2718988785981273254_204547792.jpg><p>Her film career started in 2003 with “Death of a Dynasty,” which paved the way for her to land notable parts in a number of movies, including “Sin City,” “Friendly Fire,” and “Mutant Chronicles.” Devon had his last appearance on film in the music video for “Steve Aoki Feat. BTS: Waste It on Me” in 2018.</p><p>James Bailey, the father of Eleanor Talitha Bailey, has kept a relatively low-key presence while his daughter Devon Aoki has made a name for herself in the entertainment world. James, who was born on August 3, 1985, and attended Harvard University for his education, has always had a strong interest in business and money.</p><p>His emphasis on business is consistent with his Boston, Massachusetts, upbringing.</p><h2 id=h3 class=wp-block-heading>A Look Into Her Parents Devon Aoki and James Bailey’s Marriage</h2><p>Devon Aoki and James Bailey discovered their own fairy tale in the glittering world. A fortuitous blind date served as the catalyst for a love tale that went beyond the big screen. They had a brief affair before taking a risk and becoming engaged in just six months. On April 23, 2011, their wedding day in Los Angeles was a joyous occasion spent with loved ones.</p><p></p><p>Their bond is based on genuine connection rather than just Hollywood magic. Eleanor Talitha Bailey, one of their four amazing children, is a treasured part of the family that Devon and James have built together, a refuge of bliss.</p><p>Their story serves as a monument to the strength of love and fidelity in a society when memories are frequently transient.</p><h2 id=h4 class=wp-block-heading>Eleanor Talitha Bailey Lives Off Her Parents</h2><p>Since Eleanor Bailey is still a young child and mostly dependent on her parents, she does not currently have a personal net worth that can be linked to her professional achievements. Nonetheless, she comes from a very wealthy family.</p><p>The well-known model and actress Devon Aoki, her mother, is estimated to be worth $30 million. Her father James Bailey, on the other hand, is thought to be worth $4 million.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.favebites.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/22114106/devonaoki_1675993896_3034779216415594784_204547792.jpg><p>Despite being young, Eleanor has represented brands like Away in ambassadorial capacities with her mother, siblings, and herself, demonstrating her early forays into the modeling industry. Eleanor might end up like her mother because of her background and experiences.</p><p>The lavish lifestyle of Devon Aoki, who owns several homes in Benedict Canyon and Los Angeles, highlights the family’s considerable fortune and gives Eleanor a privileged upbringing in a comfortable financial setting.</p><h2>Social Media</h2><p>Young people with prominent profiles, particularly those who are the offspring of well-known people, frequently keep a modest profile on social media. Eleanor Talitha Bailey is not active on Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter, and does not maintain a dedicated social media presence.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.favebites.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/22113958/devonaoki_1541052606_1902809633677149492_204547792.jpg><p>Rather, she sometimes makes an appearance on her mother Devon Aoki’s social media pages, providing insights into her life and family’s activities. This enables her to participate in her mother’s internet sharing while still enjoying her childhood in private.</p><p><strong>you may also like </strong><a href=# rel=bookmark>Evin Harrah Cosby – Celebrity Daughter | Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Relationship, Ethnicity, Career.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmion6XCra3Rp5ytr5%2Bnwal6wqikaJ2cmq6vu9Fmq5qkmam1onnBmqClnalisKa4xJupoqypYrGiwcahq56qXay2rLWMmp6eZZiatqi002alnqxdrLyzwMdmqZ6kkam2sLrSoaCpZZWpta%2B1wqKrsmWTlr%2BmsdFo</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2feleanor-talitha-bailey-celebrity-daughter-wiki-age-height-net-worth-relationship-ethnicity-career.html&text=Eleanor%20Talitha%20Bailey%20%20Celebrity%20Daughter%20%7c%20Wiki%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Relationship%2c%20Ethnicit&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2feleanor-talitha-bailey-celebrity-daughter-wiki-age-height-net-worth-relationship-ethnicity-career.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2feleanor-talitha-bailey-celebrity-daughter-wiki-age-height-net-worth-relationship-ethnicity-career.html&title=Eleanor%20Talitha%20Bailey%20%20Celebrity%20Daughter%20%7c%20Wiki%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Relationship%2c%20Ethnicit" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2feleanor-talitha-bailey-celebrity-daughter-wiki-age-height-net-worth-relationship-ethnicity-career.html&title=Eleanor%20Talitha%20Bailey%20%20Celebrity%20Daughter%20%7c%20Wiki%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Relationship%2c%20Ethnicit" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2feleanor-talitha-bailey-celebrity-daughter-wiki-age-height-net-worth-relationship-ethnicity-career.html&title=Eleanor%20Talitha%20Bailey%20%20Celebrity%20Daughter%20%7c%20Wiki%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Relationship%2c%20Ethnicit" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2feleanor-talitha-bailey-celebrity-daughter-wiki-age-height-net-worth-relationship-ethnicity-career.html&description=Eleanor%20Talitha%20Bailey%20%20Celebrity%20Daughter%20%7c%20Wiki%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Relationship%2c%20Ethnicit" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./od-hideo-kojima-son-with-wife-family-and-net-worth-2023.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Family and Net Worth 2023 The Talks Today">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./austin-coffey-died.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Austin Coffey died: What was his cause of death?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
