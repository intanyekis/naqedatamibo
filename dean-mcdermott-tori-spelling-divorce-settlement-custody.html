For that reason, it was a big deal when <strong>McDermott revealed in court what he wanted from their divorce and custody battle.</strong></p><p>This article will reveal <strong>what Dean McDermott is demanding from Tori Spelling</strong> as a part of their divorce and custody battle.

That said, once fans learned what Spelling had done, predicting what would happen next seemed easy. After all, given Spelling and McDermott's dramatic history, nobody should have expected them to have a quick and drama-free divorce.</p><p>In May 2024, an article from The Daily Mail revealed that <strong>McDermott's legal team responded to Spelling</strong>. Based on what that report revealed, it seemed <strong>extremely likely that Spelling and McDermott would have a bitter divorce.</strong> After all, McDermott's team told the court that <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he was demanding spousal support from Spelling and joint custody</a></strong> of their kids.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/nnn.png><p>According to an article from Today, <strong>McDermott and Spelling have five children together</strong>.
