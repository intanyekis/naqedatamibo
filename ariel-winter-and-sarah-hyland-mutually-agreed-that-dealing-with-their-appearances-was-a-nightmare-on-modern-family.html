Ariel Winter was 11 at the start of the show, while Hyland was 18. At a panel appearance back in 2020 at the Television Critics Association, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hyland and Winter talked the difficulties of growing in the public eye</a>. Given that their appearances kept changing, it was a constant struggle behind the scenes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“It’s really difficult to grow up in front of millions of people who have an opinion on everything you do, and who are allowed to say it at any point. “They] think they know you really well, and they think they can comment on everything you wear, everything you do, or how you grow up and change.” Hyland revealed.

So it was, like, I had episodes with me in braces. And then over the summer, once we wrapped, I had … other things … and I looked different, but I still wasn’t quite, you know, fully through puberty.”</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/julie-bowen.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Did Julie Bowen's Health Issues Make Filming Modern Family More Complicated Than It Needed To Be?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Modern Family star Julie Bowen faced health problems behind the scenes.</span><p>The pair had a couple of ways to cope.

The pain got so bad for Hyland, that she forgot about filming certain episodes.</p><p>"There are some episodes of Modern Family where I do not remember filming because I was asleep," she said. "Dead ass asleep. The episode where Haley asked [Luke for] money and he's like, 'Don't worry, I've got it on ice.' It's in the freezer or something.

I was reaching that certain level of sick," she said prior to her first transplant. "I was not able to be awake for eight hours at a time. I was so exhausted. So I'd be on the set, I'd be dead asleep, my head on the table, I would hear, 'and...'" before "action" — the cue taping was to begin — and her head would shoot up and she'd deliver her lines. When they cut, she'd fall back asleep."</p><p>A tough time for Hyland.
