A "showmance" is when houseguests fall for each other in the house and usually become a "couple." This typically results in the duo being split up by one of the members being voted out of the house. There have been numerous <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">showmances over the years</a>, but there are only a select few who have made it into a legit romance.</p><p>Some couples dated outside the house and broke up later and some are still together to this day. Some say that <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Big Brother</a></strong> has had more successful relationships than The Bachelor.&nbsp;Read on to find out if your favorite couple made it or not.</p><h2 id=jordan-lloyd-and-jeff-schroeder><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Jordan Lloyd And Jeff Schroeder</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Everyone's favorite couple, Jeff and Jordan, from seasons 11 and 13, are happily married and have two sons, Lawson and Layton. They met on season 11 and flirted all throughout. Jordan <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wound up winning</a> that season while Jeff scored America's Favorite Player. A few years later, they came back to the Big Brother house for another season. They went on The Amazing Race 16 and Marriage Bootcamp. And then after that, they appeared on season 16 of&nbsp;Big Brother where Jeff proposed.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Top 10 'Big Brother' Winners Ranked By Net Worth</a></span></p><h2 id=rachel-reilly-and-brendon-villegas><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Rachel Reilly And Brendon Villegas</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Rachel and Brendon met on season 12 and then played again on season 13. They were very loyal to each other and even stayed together after their time on Big Brother ended. After they left BB, they competed on The Amazing Race&nbsp;a few times and won once. They eventually got married and now have two kids, Adora and Adler. Rachel was very excited to be the first couple from the show to welcome a child.</p><h2 id=daniele-donato-and-dominic-briones><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Daniele Donato And Dominic Briones</span></h2><p>Dani and Dominic met on season 13, after she came back into the house with her father (who she played with on season 8).&nbsp;Dominic and Dani&nbsp;became best friends in the house and dated after the season wrapped.

She first played on season 16. She was actually in another showmance that season, but Victor was crushing hard. After they left the house they began dating, and then eventually got engaged in the Big Brother house. A bit before getting engaged, the couple competed on The Amazing Race 31 with a few other BB pairs. Their wedding was delayed due to the pandemic, but they just recently tied the knot and are expecting their first child.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Years Later: What Are The Housemates Of 'Big Brother' Season 13 Up To Now?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=cody-nickson-and-jessica-graf><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Cody Nickson And Jessica Graf</span></h2><p>Season 19's Jessica and Cody are still together today.

The couple became a quick target in the house after they started their showmance and got separated once they got voted out due to pre-jury and jury. To test their relationship even more, the pair competed on The Amazing Race 30 after leaving the Big Brother house and won.</p><h2 id=chris-swaggy-c-williams-and-bayleigh-dayton><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Chris 'Swaggy C' Williams And Bayleigh Dayton</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Swaggy C and Bayleigh had a complicated relationship.
