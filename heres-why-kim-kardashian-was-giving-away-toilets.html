As a result, before the 2010s, it was extremely uncommon to see A-list stars endorsing products even though a lot of <a href=#>celebrities headline commercials early in their careers</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Over the last decade or so, it has become more common to see celebrities promoting products, especially on social media. Despite that, most stars are only willing to put their name behind things like cars, water bottles, and make-up.</p><p>If there is one thing that has been clear about<strong> <a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a></strong> since she rose to fame, it is this, she is not your typical star. Instead, Kardashian seems to be an extremely shrewd businesswoman who has figured out the best ways to monetize her fame while still retaining her hold over her fans. Even though Kim K. is so resourceful, it still seems strange that she once got involved in offering the people toilets to use and most of her fans are unaware of that fact.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Celebs Who Got Their Big Break In TV Commercials</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=a-media-mogul>A Media Mogul</h2><p>When Kim Kardashian first rose to fame in the early-2000s, it is very safe to say that she didn’t get much respect from a lot of different people. Instead, people like Kim, most of the members of her family, and Paris Hilton were written off as being “famous for being famous”. In fairness to everyone who spoke about Kardashian that way at the time, “reality” stars of both genders often seem to get by on little more than their looks and personality.</p><p>No matter how people felt about Kim Kardashian early in her career, you have to be willfully ignorant to write off everything she has accomplished since then. After all, <a href=#>Kardashian is now worth a staggering amount of money</a> largely due to the obvious fact that she knows how to make money at every turn.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For anyone who is looking for proof of how shrewd Kim Kardashian is, all you have to do is look at the business empire she has built over the years. For example, Kardashian is still best known as a “reality” star but according to Kim, the money she makes from her television work is only a small portion of her fortune. During a 2020 appearance on the talk show My Guest Needs No Introduction With David Letterman, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kardashian made it clear why she continues to star in “reality” shows</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'Keeping Up With The Kardashians': Kim Kardashian's Most Iconic Scenes</a></span></p><p>“We would not be who we are today without Keeping Up With the Kardashians and that’s why we continue to share our lives. Even if, realistically, we can post something on social media and make more than we do a whole season.” Based on that statement, Kim Kardashian seems to be saying that her “reality” show tenure was the way she garnered attention to her more financially rewarding efforts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given that Kim Kardashian stated that she makes more money on social media than on TV, that begs an obvious question, how can she be raking in so much cash online. Since Kardashian is such a popular celebrity, there are loads of brands who are willing to pay her a fortune to associate herself with them. For example, some companies pay Kardashian lots of cash simply to feature their products in her social media posts.</p><p>Of course, there are only a few people in the world who could know exactly <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">how much money Kim Kardashian makes from endorsements</a>. However, assuming that Kardashian’s comment about social media posts was accurate, it has to be a mind-blowing number since it has been reported that she made millions of dollars for each season of her “reality” show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Cast Of 'Keeping Up With The Kardashians' At The Start Of The Show Vs. Now</a></span></p><h2 id=an-amazing-endorsement>An Amazing Endorsement</h2><p>When a celebrity becomes admired by millions of people the way that Kim Kardashian has, their fans typically want to pattern themselves after the star in some ways. As a result, when a star goes out in public or talks about the products they use, their most devoted fans will try to follow their lead. For example, there is a reason why most companies would do just about anything to have one of their products land on Oprah’s list of her favorite things.</p><p>Even though it makes perfect sense that most brands love to be associated with stars, there are some examples of celebrity endorsements that were baffling, to say the least. For example, in 2010, the toilet paper company Charmin decided to pay Kim Kardashian money to promote their toilet paper. Amazingly enough, the Kardashian and Charmin relationship becomes all the more confusing once you learn the details about it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2010, the famous toilet paper company held the 5th Annual Charmin Holiday Toilets in New York City. During that event, Charmin set up a pop-up shop filled with toilet stalls they invited everyone to come use. For some reason, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Charmin paid Kim Kardashian to speak at their event opening, endorse the brand, and cut the ribbon</a> opening up a slew of toilets to the general public.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Kim Kardashian Regrets Ever Promoting This Endorsed Product</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tNhmoqKlXaCus7DArJ%2BimZ5ixKK%2FjKCgr6GenHqiw8CyZK2nmaGytb%2BO</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fheres-why-kim-kardashian-was-giving-away-toilets.html&text=Kim%20Kardashian%20Was%20Giving%20Away%20Toilets%20And%20Fans%20Are%20Shocked%20By%20Why&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fheres-why-kim-kardashian-was-giving-away-toilets.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fheres-why-kim-kardashian-was-giving-away-toilets.html&title=Kim%20Kardashian%20Was%20Giving%20Away%20Toilets%20And%20Fans%20Are%20Shocked%20By%20Why" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fheres-why-kim-kardashian-was-giving-away-toilets.html&title=Kim%20Kardashian%20Was%20Giving%20Away%20Toilets%20And%20Fans%20Are%20Shocked%20By%20Why" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fheres-why-kim-kardashian-was-giving-away-toilets.html&title=Kim%20Kardashian%20Was%20Giving%20Away%20Toilets%20And%20Fans%20Are%20Shocked%20By%20Why" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fheres-why-kim-kardashian-was-giving-away-toilets.html&description=Kim%20Kardashian%20Was%20Giving%20Away%20Toilets%20And%20Fans%20Are%20Shocked%20By%20Why" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./natasha-bedingfield-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Natasha Bedingfield Net Worth  How Much is Natasha Bedingfield Worth?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./jean-knight-mr-big-stuff-dead-80-1234822062.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jean Knight, &amp;quot;Mr. Big Stuff&amp;quot; Singer, Dead At 80">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
