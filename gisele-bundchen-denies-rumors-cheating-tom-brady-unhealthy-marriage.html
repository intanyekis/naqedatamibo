Because they knew each other before she divorced Tom Brady, people have been speculating that they split up because she cheated on her ex-husband with him.</p><p><strong>Gisele Bundchen hasn't spoken much about her fairly new relationship, but she did <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">set the record straight regarding the rumors of infidelity</a>. "That’s a lie," she stated</strong>.</p><p>She went on to say that she left because their marriage was "unhealthy", not because of her relationship with Joaquim Valente, and complained about the treatment she received since the divorce.</p><p>"<strong>This is something that happens to a lot of women who get blamed when they have the courage to leave an unhealthy relationship and are labeled as being unfaithful</strong>," she continued. "They have to deal with their communities. They have to deal with their family. Of course, for me, it just happens to be a little bit amplified. No one really knows what happens between two people, only the two people in the relationship."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Reportedly, Tom Brady doesn't believe she wasn't seeing the instructor before their marriage was over, but he won't dwell on it.</p><p>"<strong>If she wants to have people think she has been dating Joaquim only since June, so be it, but they have been together longer and they aren’t taking it slow. Tom has accepted it</strong>," a source said. He also knows that Gisele's new boyfriend is a decent person, and won't stand in the way.</p><p>"Tom and Joaquim are not friends — but Joaquim is around his kids, so Tom has to find the good in him and does believe he is a good guy," the source added. "If Joaquim ever becomes a father figure to his kids, Tom will be able to adapt."</p><h2 id=despite-moving-on-gisele-bundchen-still-mourns-the-end-of-her-marriage>Despite Moving On, Gisele Bundchen Still Mourns The End Of Her Marriage</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/gisele-bundchen-vtex-day-event-in-brazil.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Gisele Bundchen is reportedly very happy now with Joaquim Valente, with sources saying that they are "madly in love."
