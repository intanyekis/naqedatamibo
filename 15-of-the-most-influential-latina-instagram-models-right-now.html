But times appear to be changing, and model scouts no longer walk the streets in search of the looks of the future. They track social networks for photogenic faces and perfect features. In fact, the&nbsp;model of a Marc by Marc Jacobs' campaign&nbsp;was&nbsp;chosen from a casting that took place exclusively on Instagram. They received over 50,000 applications. The initiative was so successful in the media that it has been repeated.</p><p>If we talk about sought-after models representing the Latin race, names such as Lais Ribeiro, Adriana Lima,&nbsp;and Alessandra Ambrosio, immediately come to mind. However, it should be noted that in other Latin countries there is also an incredible talent that you should know. Maybe not all of them are up to the task of being a Victoria's Secret angel since only a select group in the world can do it, but they are beautiful women, with thousands and millions of followers on Instagram. Believe us that for no reason you will regret following these gorgeous and lovely Latinas.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=anllela-sagra-anllela-sagra>Anllela Sagra | @anllela_sagra</h2><p>More than 10 million fans put this fitness and modeling goddess as one of the Latin queens of Instagram. This 24-year-old girl has become a social phenomenon that serves as a reference and motivation for half of South America and a big part of the rest of the world. Anllela says she was always thin during her modeling days in her native Medellín, in Colombia. She was a regular gym attendee, but without any knowledge of what she should or shouldn't eat to stay in good shape. She was quite happy with her body, her long straight hair, and her legs. But there was one part she didn't like— her butt. However, that wasn't her only obsession, so were her abs. She'd wanted to have a six-pack for years, but it was getting harder over the time. But that is just history... so, if you want to know what her obsessions turned out to be, just check out her photos on Instagram.</p><h2 id=pen-lope-sosa-penelopesosaofficial>Penélope Sosa | @penelopesosaofficial</h2><p>The beautiful face of this Venezuelan girl has been in important campaigns for brands like Oscar de La Renta. Sosa is part of the renowned Elite Model Management agency, one of the most respected modeling agencies in the world, and currently has almost 39,000 followers on Instagram. In addition, she has been the face of the American department store, Target, the smile of Crest, and&nbsp;has even done McDonald's campaigns. Penélope Sosa has managed to captivate all the screens, not to mention that she has shared the catwalk with models of the quality of Gisele Bündchen and Adriana Lima, just to name a few. As a model, she recognizes that beauty is key to her career, but clarifies that without personality and intelligence, she can't get anywhere. Without a doubt, a career full of constant learning that has turned her into a complete woman.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=daniela-de-jes-s-cos-o-realdanielacosio>Daniela de Jesús Cosío | @realdanielacosio</h2><p>The taste of tequila is provided by the Mexican Daniela De Jesus Cosio. Recently, the website, Models.com, included her in The Money Girls list, which includes the best-paid models. Born in La Paz, Baja California, she began her career in modeling after being crowned Nuestra Belleza México in 2005, and from that moment on she reached new goals until she went on to perform for internationally renowned brands such as Jean Paul Gaultier, Vivienne Westwood, Giorgio Armani, and Zuhair Murad. As part of her beauty rituals, Cosio admits that to take care of her skin she always uses moisturizing creams in the morning and at night, and washes her face before going to bed. But she also goes to the gym at least three times a week and has a balanced diet that is low in carbs.</p><h2 id=natalie-stal-nataliestal>Natalie Stal | @nataliestal</h2><p>After winning the Elite Model Look in her native Uruguay, the name Natalie Stal began to sound more intense in 2012. This contest took her to the World Cup in Shanghai at the end of that year, and since then, her career has taken off like a space rocket. Just months before, Natalie made her first appearance on the catwalk of Itau MoWeek and on the cover of Galeria&nbsp;magazine. But it was only after her participation in the Elite Model Look that Stal was given the great opportunity to travel to Paris and work in the fashion capital as a model by the Angels & Demons agency. Natalie settled in Paris after being hired by this agency, making her life in Europe an adventure. She is currently one of the most sought-after models in Argentina and has performed for Natalia Antolin and Tramando.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=elizabeth-loaiza-elizabethloaiza>Elizabeth Loaiza | @elizabethloaiza</h2><p>Elizabeth Loaiza Junca is one of the most desired, loved, and popular models thanks to her trajectory with different advertising campaigns in her native country, Colombia, but also in South America. She has also been on the cover of different adult magazines such as Playboy, Soho, and Don Juan. Her sensual photo shoots are simply spectacular, as this woman's fierce gaze can melt even the coldest man on the planet. Just take a look at their photos and videos on Instagram to see what we are saying. The gorgeous model, who now has more than 1 million followers on Instagram, said she recently received a proposal to make a videotape of her having intercourse with a famous adult industry actor, but Loaiza rejected the 1 million dollars they offered her outright.</p><h2 id=waleska-gorczevski-waleskagorczevski>Waleska Gorczevski | @waleskagorczevski</h2><p>In Brazil, they can rest assure that they have a promising generation of newcomers, including Walüska Gorczevski. This is confirmed by those who have fallen at her feet, including Marc Jacobs, Calvin Klein, Prada, Dolce & Gabbana, Chanel, Valentino, Miu Miu, Christian Dior, and Lanvin. Are you wondering where they get the energy to model for so many signatures? We believe their only secret is youth. At 21, Brazil's Waleska Gorczevski is one of the most sought-after models on the catwalk. While the end of the career of the beautiful Lais Ribeiro, Adriana Lima, and Alessandra Ambrosio is still a long way off, Gorczevski will be able to take the baton when the time comes. It will only be a matter of waiting because this woman will not have any problem in continuing to devour the fashion world without hesitation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=luisa-de-freitas-luludf>Luisa de Freitas | @luludf</h2><p>The timeline of your Instagram account will be definitely be embellished with this Portuguese-Venezuelan girl.

Plus, one day she's in Miami, the next day in Mexico, then in Los Angeles, and later, in Milan.... so, your chances of meeting her on the streets of these beautiful cities will be higher. With Portuguese and Venezuelan roots, de Freitas is everything a man looks for in a woman, or ask J Balvin, one of the most popular reggaeton artists around. In March of last year, the possible romance between the singer and the model was strongly felt, but nothing had ever been officially established. It all began in November 2016, when the Ginza performer attended the Latin Grammy ceremony accompanied by the slender Venezuelan.</p><h2 id=mica-arganaraz-micarganaraz>Mica Arganaraz | @micarganaraz</h2><p>There is no one in the Latin American fashion industry who does not know Mica Arganaraz. This Argentine has signed with agencies such as One Management, Why Not, Viva, and&nbsp;has walked the runway for Isabel Marant, Chloé, Stella McCartney, Louis Vuitton, and Miu Miu. She also appeared on the cover of Vogue magazine. This model of dark complexion and strong appearance has arrived in the fashion world to reign over the catwalks. And there is no relevant runway that does not include her in its casting. Mica represents a new generation of models that, far from the classic canons, are imposing new forms of beauty. Arganaraz was living and studying in Buenos Aires when decided she wanted to be a model and sent Polaroids to the agency Lo Management. That was the beginning of a promising career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=paulina-vega-paulinavegadiep>Paulina Vega | @paulinavegadiep</h2><p>Paulina Vega is a model, presenter, and former Colombian beauty queen, elected Miss Colombia 2013-2014 and winner of the Miss Universe 2014 title.After handing over the Miss Universe crown, Vega assumed the position of World Ambassador for Food Security at the international non-profit organization, Stop Hunger Now.

Miuccia Prada's last muse was discovered while she was in a skate park in her native, Santo Domingo. After her signing, this Dominican traveled to Paris, New York,&nbsp;and Milan without speaking English, a fact that has not prevented her from becoming the real revelation of the catwalks with dozens of fashion shows for brands and designers such as Givenchy, Michael Kors, Tommy Hilfiger, or Coach. In addition to walking on the catwalk, Lineisy has been featured&nbsp;in&nbsp;Teen Vogue and&nbsp;Dazed & Confused. A fashion lover since she was a child, she says her real dream is to become a fashion designer. Her afro hair has been a revolution and a breath of fresh air among so much straight hair.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=issa-lish-issalien>Issa Lish | @issalien</h2><p>The Asian ancestry of this Mexican makes her an exotic model that many brands and designers want to have in their ranks. Her first cover was for none other than Vogue Italy. Saint Laurent, Vivienne Westwood, and Yohji Yamamoto are also on her list. With a strong walk and relaxed look, the Mexican model, Issa Lish, conquers the catwalks of the big international fashion brands. Originally from Mexico City, she was discovered at the age of 14 by her current agent, Wanted Model Management, at her parents' sushi restaurant. This model has Mexican and Japanese blood, so Issa Lish has a very particular beauty that has captivated great personalities of the fashion industry. After all, a racial mix between Latina and Asian had to leave a fascinating result, don’t you think so?</p><h2 id=ang-lica-duque-angelicaduquemodel>Angélica Duque | @angelicaduquemodel</h2><p>When she was 14 years old, Angélica Duque was already 5'7" tall, and she exchanged volleyball for modeling and made her debut on the catwalks of the most important designers in Colombia and the world.

She rose to fame after winning the eighth season of America's Next Top Model and has since aggressively entered the fashion industry. As a result of her Latino background, González has been successful in promoting herself in the Spanish and English-speaking world. However, González is much more— she is a warrior, humanitarian, and a good granddaughter. Born in Chicago to a Latina mother and a Puerto Rican father, Gonzalez has in many ways had a typical Latino-American experience. She had a united family, loving grandparents, and spirituality also played an important part in her development. After winning ANTM, Gonzalez became a spokeswoman for Liz Claiborne and the National Domestic Violence Hotline and began traveling across the country to reach out to women in different topics such as harassment and violence.</p><h2 id=joan-smalls-joansmalls>Joan Smalls | @joansmalls</h2><p>This beautiful brunette was born in Hatillo, Puerto Rico and spent her childhood and youth on a farm that produced fruit and cattle. She learned about modeling by watching fashion shows on television. By the age of 13, she had already entered local modeling competitions, in which she never won.

Since working with Givenchy in 2010, Smalls has modeled haute couture and ready-to-wear collections for designers and fashion houses such as Chanel, Prada, Gucci, Marc Jacobs, Tom Ford, and Burberry. In 2012, Smalls was named model of the year at the 9th Style Awards and was ranked number one on Models.com's Top 50 Model of the Year list that same year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=greeicy-rend-n-greeicy1>Greeicy Rendón | @greeicy1</h2><p>Miss Rendón is now enjoying the honeysuckle of success thanks to the release of her newest single, "Amantes."

On her musical side, there is no doubt that she hopes to continue growing. Nevertheless, it is clear that one of her dreams is to sing with J Balvin. But Rendón doesn't want to accelerate her career and wants to go step by step. She will continue with her role as an actor and model for different brands in her country, since, thanks to these two talents, she obtained the recognition and fame that today more than 4 million followers have given her in Instagram.</p><p>References: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Univision</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vogue</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmqaegYrC2uNOuqZ5nYWp6sLKMrZ%2BeZZ2kwLV5yKedpa2Vo8Gqrctmo5qsmaOubrXNrKuan6KWum65zp2cpatdp7aotNNmpaivXw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f15-of-the-most-influential-latina-instagram-models-right-now.html&text=15%20Of%20The%20Most%20Influential%20Online%20Latina%20Models%20Right%20Now&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f15-of-the-most-influential-latina-instagram-models-right-now.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f15-of-the-most-influential-latina-instagram-models-right-now.html&title=15%20Of%20The%20Most%20Influential%20Online%20Latina%20Models%20Right%20Now" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f15-of-the-most-influential-latina-instagram-models-right-now.html&title=15%20Of%20The%20Most%20Influential%20Online%20Latina%20Models%20Right%20Now" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f15-of-the-most-influential-latina-instagram-models-right-now.html&title=15%20Of%20The%20Most%20Influential%20Online%20Latina%20Models%20Right%20Now" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f15-of-the-most-influential-latina-instagram-models-right-now.html&description=15%20Of%20The%20Most%20Influential%20Online%20Latina%20Models%20Right%20Now" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./anayah-rice-htm.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Anayah Rice - Bio, Age, Wiki, Facts and Family">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./tony-bennett.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tony Bennett Height, Weight, Family, Facts, Spouse, Education, Biography">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
