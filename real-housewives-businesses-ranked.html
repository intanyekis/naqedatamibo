Yes, either before, during, or after their fame on Bravo TV, several of these leading ladies started collections, opened restaurants, developed stores and—in a couple of cases—created empires.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, not all of these ventures were super successful (toaster oven by Sonja Morgan, anyone?), but the ones below seem to have done pretty well or even very well for themselves. From beauty and accessory lines to gyms, drinks, and boutiques, here are some of the best businesses by Real Housewives, ranked.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Every Cast Member Of The Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills Net Worth</a></span></p><h2 id=kenya-moore-hair-care>Kenya Moore Hair Care</h2><p>Kenya Moore from <i>The Real Housewives Of Atlanta </i>started Kenya Moore Hair Care, which offers up items such as a hair vitamin, a restorative mask, a growth serum and a growth repair shampoo and a conditioner. Yes, this former Miss USA is sharing her secrets for growing longer and stronger hair. The products, which work with all types of hair, are free of sulfate, phosphate, and paraben and are 95 percent natural. According to her website, this line can be purchased at Sally Beauty Supply stores across the country and through Amazon. And let’s be honest; she does have great hair!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=gretchen-christine>Gretchen Christine</h2><p>Gretchen Rossi from <i>The Real Housewives Of Orange County </i>started Gretchen Christine, a line of luggage, handbags, beauty products, and accessories such as a wallet. This business was seen when this star was on Bravo TV, but a couple of years ago it was acquired by a large beauty brand. Still, the website and Instagram are up and running, though they haven’t been posted to in a while. And recent reports show that Rossi and Slade Smiley have now joined BioReigns Inc. to bring about the only truly water-soluble CBD products available, so stay tuned to see how this new venture pans out...</p><h2 id=consult-beaute>Consult Beaute</h2><p>Heather Dubrow, who also used to be on <i>The Real Housewives Of Orange County, </i>started Consult Beaute with her husband, a well-known plastic surgeon who has appeared on Bravo TV and on E! Television. This anti-aging line, which is available at evine.com, features creams and supplements that exist to help support healthy hair, skin and nails. Fans of this show have seen the Dubrows try out all kinds of crazy health and beauty treatments and products, so if they think they have found the answer to great-looking skin… maybe they actually have?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lvp-sangria>LVP Sangria</h2><p>In Beverly Hills, Lisa Vanderpump has some notable restaurants and bars, but she also started LVP Sangria. These premium wines are natural, with no added sugar, and are ready to drink. The company launched in Los Angeles and Miami with a traditional red and a true-to-LVP pink. The website says to call local retailers for availability, and though we couldn’t find any, it is probably safe to assume that Vanderpump knows her sangria just based on the success of SUR and PUMP alone. This may not be the most celebrated Housewife company, but it belongs on this list!</p><h2 id=indulge>Indulge</h2><p><i>The Real Housewives Of New Jersey’s </i>Kathy Wakile gave the world the Dolci Della Dea cannoli kit, the Red Velvet Cosmo, and <i>Indulge: Delicious Little Desserts That Keep Life Real Sweet</i>. On her website, people can also learn more about the INDULGE by Kathy Wakile line, which has speciality foods such as chips and dips, desserts, and gluten-free items. Cooking is very important to this ex-Housewife, so it is nice that she is using her passion in so many creative ways and offering up her treats to the public. She is also a partner at PizzaLove, an Italian restaurant in New Jersey.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=envy-by-melissa-gorga>Envy by Melissa Gorga</h2><p>Also in New Jersey is Envy by Melissa Gorga. Viewers have watched this fashionista go back and forth with her husband Joe on whether or not she should be working, but she had a dream, and she made it happen. This boutique is full of pieces ranging from dresses and rompers to bathing suits and jewelry. There are even some items for men, as well. It is clear that Gorga enjoys getting made up and experimenting with her look, and she is able to provide stylish options for others, with this store in Montclair.</p><h2 id=cynthia-bailey-eyewear>Cynthia Bailey Eyewear</h2><p>Cynthia Bailey from <i>The Real Housewives Of Atlanta </i>already had a name for herself in the world of fashion before starting Cynthia Bailey Eyewear; she has modeled for years, the Bailey Agency School of Fashion opened in 2011, and she then started lines consisting of products such as bags, candles, leather goods and, of course, eyewear. Everyone loves a good pair of sunglasses, and this fashionista has seemed to have fun with this venture. There have been several accessory lines within The Real Housewives franchise, and this is one of the good ones with its sunwear, optical frames, and collaboration with Steve Madden.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bedroom-kandi>Bedroom Kandi</h2><p>Also from Atlanta is Kandi Burruss, who started Bedroom Kandi. This company makes intimate toys, books, bath & body items, products just for him, product bundles, and so on. There are even Bedroom Kandi Boutique Parties, where consultants can sell all of this—like a modern-day Tupperware party! From singing, producing, and songwriting (she has a Grammy due to her work on the TLC song "No Scrubs") to spin-off shows on Bravo and a web series called Kandi Koated Nights, this RHOA star is bringing the fun, in several different and very real ways.</p><h2 id=lisa-rinna-collection>Lisa Rinna Collection</h2><p>Another fashion line comes from Lisa Rinna of Beverly Hills. Her collection through the shopping channel QVC has clothing items like v-neck tees, joggers, sweaters, skirts, jeans, jumpsuits, dresses, and dusters in an array of colors and styles. Fans of this show have seen this actress travel and go on TV in order to sell the Lisa Rinna Collection; everything seems to go very quickly, and even some of her costars have been seen wearing these products. The clothes do look fun and comfy—two important aspects, for many, when it comes to picking outfits.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ageless-by-ramona>AGELESS by Ramona</h2><p>Ramona Singer from <i>The Real Housewives Of New York </i>started AGELESS by Ramona (after she started Ramona Singer Pinot Grigio, of course). According to this product’s website, Singer has been interested in the science of beauty, so she teamed up with some of the best dermatological scientists in the country to create this serum. It is supposed to delay any signs of aging with its “three powerhouse ingredients”. Also, let us all remember that this Housewife is 62 years old… 62! We would gladly try what she is offering if we will end up looking that good.</p><h2 id=cut-fitness>CUT Fitness</h2><p>Tamra Judge from <i>The Real Housewives Of Orange County </i>started CUT Fitness, a studio that offers personal training and small group training. This gym is seen quite often on RHOC, as her and her husband, Eddie, have put a great deal of work into it—and into their own bodies! Yes, judging by its online presence, the scenes that show off its different sessions and how the owners themselves look, this place seems to be doing pretty well for itself. These two also just launched a CBD company called VENA Wellness, so we will see how that does.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=skinnygirl>Skinnygirl</h2><p>As everyone knows, Bethenny Frankel of RHONY has Skinnygirl. This all started with the Skinnygirl Margarita, but now, there are multiple cocktails. From there, she expanded into selling everything from candy, meat, popcorn, and dressing to shapewear and jeans. In 2011, Frankel actually sold Skinnygirl Cocktails to Fortune Brands’ Beam Global, according to People, and on a recent episode of <i>The Real Housewives Of New York, </i>she confessed that she may be ready to sell part of the Skinnygirl company. Whatever her next step is, it is safe to say that this empire is the most successful one out of all the brands started by The Real Housewives.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>The Real Housewives: 20 Things Their Lawyers Don't Want Us To Know</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS%2Fpq3LZp%2BoraOaxKrCxKxkm62jnrumv9KeqmaqkaO4prCO</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2freal-housewives-businesses-ranked.html&text=Businesses%20Started%20By%20The%20Real%20Housewives%2c%20Ranked&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2freal-housewives-businesses-ranked.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2freal-housewives-businesses-ranked.html&title=Businesses%20Started%20By%20The%20Real%20Housewives%2c%20Ranked" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2freal-housewives-businesses-ranked.html&title=Businesses%20Started%20By%20The%20Real%20Housewives%2c%20Ranked" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2freal-housewives-businesses-ranked.html&title=Businesses%20Started%20By%20The%20Real%20Housewives%2c%20Ranked" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2freal-housewives-businesses-ranked.html&description=Businesses%20Started%20By%20The%20Real%20Housewives%2c%20Ranked" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./texans-sign-zach-cunningham-to-58-million-extension.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Houston Texans Sign Zach Cunningham To $58 Million Contract Extension">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./alexandria-cress-borys-gofundme-fundraiser-launched-as-woman-is-shot-to-death-in-grocery-store-parking-lot-578998-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Alexandria Cress Borys GoFundMe: Fundraiser launched as woman is shot to death in grocery store par">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
