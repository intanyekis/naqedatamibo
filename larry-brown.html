With his guidance and support, he guided the former team to the franchise’s first-ever playoff appearance.&nbsp;</p><p>After a record of 9-19 in 2010, Brown parted his ways with the Charlotte Bobcats.&nbsp;</p><p>ESPN reported in April 2012 that Brown was the new head coach of the SMU Mustangs. With Brown’s guidance and effort, the SMU went into the following year’s national conversation (2012-2013).</p><p>The former team coached by Brown went on to be the overall number-one seed in National Invitational Tournament; however, they lost to Minnesota.&nbsp;</p><p>In the 2014-2015 season, SMU won the American Athletic Conference tournament and secured their first&nbsp; NCAA Tournament appearance since 1993.</p><p>Brown was suspended in September 2015 by the NCAA for 30% of the Mustangs’ games in the upcoming 2015–2016 season.</p><p>Later, the team was banned from 2016 post-season play, placed on probation for three years, and lost nine scholarships over three years.&nbsp;</p><h4>Auxilium Torino&nbsp;</h4><p>After the ban, Larry Brown accepted the proposal to be the Italian basketball club head coach, Auxilium Tornio.</p><p>The former team had won the bronze medal at the Olympics but failed to win gold at the Dummer Olympics.&nbsp;</p><h4>University Of Memphis</h4><p>Larry joined the coaching staff of the Memphis Tigers men’s basketball program in June 2021, as an assistant coach under head coach and former player Penny Hardway.</p><p>Earlier, Brown had served as an assistant coach in 1967.&nbsp;</p><p>As of October, Larry took leave as an assistant coach due to health issues.

Even as an assistant coach in the 2000 Olympics, Larry brought home the gold.</p><p>Nevertheless, as a head coach, the former athlete could not achieve the same success. He coached the men’s national basketball team in the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, for the first time since 1992, when NBA players were first permitted to take part in Olympics, the U.S. men’s basketball team had failed to secure the gold medal. Instead, they went home with the bronze medal.</p><p>Furthermore, Puerto Rico defeated them in the opening game with a score of 73-92, which is the most significant margin of defeat for the U.S. team in the Olympics to this date.&nbsp;</p><p>After that, the team lost to Lithuania before losing to Argentina in the semi-finals.

The legendary coach said that he and most likely his assistant coach, Gregg Popovich, still haven’t gotten over the 2004 Olympics.&nbsp;</p><p>Likewise, he is the only head coach not to win the Olympic tournament since 1992. Since then, the Hall of Fame coach hasn’t coached the U.S. national team in the Olympics.</p><h4>Tokyo 2020 Olympics</h4><p>However, his then-assistant coach and mentee, Popovich, is serving as the head coach of the men’s basketball team in the current Tokyo 2020 Olympics.</p><p>Gregg is considered one of the greatest coaches in the NBA franchise history and has won the Spurs five NBA championships.</p><p>Besides that, the Tokyo 2020 roster has outstanding players like Kevin Durant, <a href=# rel=noopener>Draymond Green</a>, <a href=# rel=noopener>Devin Booker,</a> <a href=# rel=noopener>Khris Middleton</a>, <a href=# rel=noopener>Jrue Holiday</a>, etc. Hence, Popovich hopes to continue the tradition of bringing the gold home.&nbsp;</p><h2>Larry Brown | Net Worth And Salary</h2><p>The former American basketball coach is said to have a net worth of 70 million dollars.
