Stanley and Gladys had met in California a few years earlier and were both involved in the film industry.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, their marriage was not a happy one and they divorced when Monroe was just six years old. Stanley gained custody of Monroe and her half-sister, Berniece, but he was not a good father. He was often drunk and abusive, and he neglected his daughters’ needs. As a result, Monroe had a difficult childhood.&nbsp;</p><p>Although she never knew her father well, she did maintain some contact with him over the years. He died in 1961, just a few months before Monroe passed away. Despite their estrangement, Monroe always considered Stanley to be her father and she reportedly kept a picture of him on her dresser until the day she died.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What Role Does Marilyn Monroe’s Dad Play In The Movie ‘Blonde’</h2><p>Blonde, featuring Marilyn Monroe, eventually debuted on Netflix on September 28, 2022, after much anticipation.</p><p>The movie, which blends fact and fiction to depict a very disturbed existence that includes a number of deeply terrible experiences, is not a standard <a href=#>biography</a> but rather a fictionalized adaptation of the same-named novel by Joyce Carol Oates.</p><p>You might be asking how much of this aspect of the movie is based on fact because it is a theme that the movie often returns to Norma Jeane’s relationship with her father, or rather, her lack of a relationship with her father.</p><p>In the film, Gladys is portrayed as a very disturbed woman who at one point even tries to drown her daughter in the bathtub.&nbsp;</p><p>Although there is no proof that the bathtub event truly took place, Monroe did grow up in a toxic family. Marilyn lived in a number of orphanages and foster homes without a genuine parent after Gladys was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia.&nbsp;</p><p>In the films, Monroe expresses her absence of a father figure in a variety of ways, including by calling a number of her partners “Daddy” and making repeated attempts to find her father.</p><p>She believes she is about to be reunited with her long-lost father in one scene where she is told there is a surprise waiting for her in her hotel room, and at the end of the movie, she thinks she has finally gotten a letter from him – only to be disappointed once more.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Marilyn Monroe Had A Troubled Childhood Because Of Her Dad’s Absence</h2><p>Marilyn Monroe had a troubled childhood. Her mother, Gladys, was paranoid and often struggled with mental health issues. As a result, Monroe was shuttled between foster homes and orphanages for much of her childhood.&nbsp;</p><p>Her father, Stanley, was largely absent from her life, and she only saw him sporadically. When he did visit, he was often critical of her appearance and made hurtful comments about her weight. Monroe also faced sexual abuse at the hands of some of her caretakers.&nbsp;</p><p>These early experiences had a profound effect on Monroe and shaped her view of relationships and her own self-worth. While she would go on to become one of the most famous actresses in Hollywood, Monroe always carried the scars of her difficult childhood with her.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Till What Extent Of The Marilyn Monroe Movie ‘Blonde’ Is True?</h2><p>Marilyn Monroe begged a reporter not to make fun of her just before she passed away. She only desired to be respected and loved by others. In the recent movie Blonde, she becomes a sexual and unfunny punch line. It goes to absurd lengths to minimize and demean her.&nbsp;</p><p>To be fair, Blonde’s creator Joyce Carol Oates and director Andrew Dominik have both been upfront about the movie being pure fiction. The settings, attire, and hairstyles are appropriate.&nbsp;</p><p>Cinematographer Chayse Irvin expertly recreates memorable moments from her life on camera. However, there isn’t a single line that Marilyn really says in the movie.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunC%2F05qlpZ2pYrqwvtOepaydnmK6or7IpbCnZZ2ku7O7xGadmqyYmr9w</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fstanley-mortensen-marilyn-monroe-father.html&text=Who%20Is%20Marilyn%20Monroes%20Father%3f%20What%20Happened%20To%20Him%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fstanley-mortensen-marilyn-monroe-father.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fstanley-mortensen-marilyn-monroe-father.html&title=Who%20Is%20Marilyn%20Monroes%20Father%3f%20What%20Happened%20To%20Him%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fstanley-mortensen-marilyn-monroe-father.html&title=Who%20Is%20Marilyn%20Monroes%20Father%3f%20What%20Happened%20To%20Him%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fstanley-mortensen-marilyn-monroe-father.html&title=Who%20Is%20Marilyn%20Monroes%20Father%3f%20What%20Happened%20To%20Him%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fstanley-mortensen-marilyn-monroe-father.html&description=Who%20Is%20Marilyn%20Monroes%20Father%3f%20What%20Happened%20To%20Him%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./alexandria-cress-borys-gofundme-fundraiser-launched-as-woman-is-shot-to-death-in-grocery-store-parking-lot-578998-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Alexandria Cress Borys GoFundMe: Fundraiser launched as woman is shot to death in grocery store par">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./where-is-gary-kemp-now-what-is-gary-kemp-doing-now.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Where is Gary Kemp now?
