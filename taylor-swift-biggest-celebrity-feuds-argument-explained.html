Well, you can say that Taylor Swift seems to demonstrate a straight-off-the-playground bully mentality that any woman her age should have long since outgrown.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Taylor's universe is divided into "Taylor's friends" and "Taylor's enemies". She also has a tendency to think that everything is about her, taking offense at even the most general comments. She is also over-entitled. Try to book some dancers she wants or buy the rights to some of her older music and you have made an enemy for life. Just ask&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Katy Perry</a> or Scooter Braun. And gosh help you if you are a former boyfriend she has taken a dislike to. There will be at least one song out there that attempts to diss, embarrass, or outrage you.</p><p>So, surprise, surprise. Taylor Swift has had a lot of feuds. In fact, if you were constructing a list of the celebrities with the longest feud list, she would be right up there.</p><p>Here are 15 of Taylor's feuds explained, as best we can. See, it's not always logical.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kanye-west><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Kanye West</span></h2><p>Back at the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MTV VMA Awards in 2009</a>, Taylor Swift won the best female video award. Only <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kanye West </a>didn't agree. He actually stormed the stage ranting and raving about how great Beyoncé's video that year was. That was the beginning of a long-running feud between the two. Easy to understand Taylor's attitude. Unforgivable! But then, hey, it's Kayne.</p><h2 id=katy-perry><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Katy Perry</span></h2><p>It seems the whole feud thing got started when they both tried to book the same backup dancers for their concert tours. Taylor hit back with a single called "Bad Blood" and Katy came back strong with a song called "Swish Swish". It's an on-again-off-again thing that seems to get revived if the girls have an album about to drop or a tour on the horizon. The only bad publicity is no publicity.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Little Know Facts About Orlando Bloom and Katy Perry's Relationship</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=scooter-braun><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Scooter Braun</span></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Scooter Braun</a>, the manager behind Justin Bieber and Ariana Grande, bought a company called Big Machine in 2019. So? Well it seems the company held the rights to some of Swift's earlier albums. Like Big Machine was supposed to offer to sell the rights to Swift before it sold the company to Braun? Get real. Swift has dissed, insulted, and shamed Braun on every platform there is. Like nobody ever accused her of being under-entitled</p><h2 id=nicki-minaj><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Nicki Minaj</span></h2><p>In 2015 when Swift's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">music video&nbsp;Bad Blood was nominated</a> for a VMA video of the year award, Nicki Minaj was left out of the nomination. She took to social media ranting about how you have to be a skinny white woman to get a nod. Of course, thinking everything is about her, Swift takes offense. Pretty soon, though, the two kiss and make up and appear together on stage at the VMAs.</p><h2 id=kim-kardashian><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Kim Kardashian</span></h2><p>In 2016, Taylor Swift either did or didn't give Kanye West permission to use the "b" word referring to her in his song "Famous". Well, he did. Taylor went ballistic. In wades, Kanye's wife Kim Kardashian West saying Swift lied and that she did give permission. It seemed most people sided with Kim and Kanye in that one, calling Swift a "snake". Yes, she used it in a song.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> A List Of All The Celebs Kim Kardashian Has Feuded With</a></span></p><h2 id=joe-jonas><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Joe Jonas</span></h2><p>Taylor's take on the whole "write songs that diss your ex" thing is that it's the ex's fault for doing something bad. Something bad is defined as something Taylor doesn't like. In 2008, Jonas and Taylor were dating. He took less than 30 seconds to break up with her over the phone. Okay, he deserves a jerk alert. But Taylor got four really good songs out of it, including "Holy Ground". She zinged him good.</p><h2 id=demi-lovato><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Demi Lovato</span></h2><p>Girls fighting on the playground time. Demi Lovato and&nbsp;singer Selena Gomez were buds. Then in 2010 Selena entered the Holy of Holies and became part of "the squad". Demi was jealous. When asked how Selena was, she quipped, that the person should ask Swiftie. It didn't help when it later emerged DL was dating Taylor's ex, Joe Jonas. Demi and Taylor just don't get along.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=calvin-harris><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Calvin Harris</span></h2><p>DJ Calvin Harris and Taylor Swift broke up in 2016. Then, bizarrely, she hooked up with hunky actor Tom Hiddleston. Meanwhile, Harris released a song called "This Is What We Came For" in collaboration with Rihanna. It was his biggest hit. But it seems that Taylor co-wrote the song. And every time he sings it, he'll think of her. Torture.</p><h2 id=john-mayer><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>John Mayer</span></h2><p>OK. It was destined to fail. He was 32-years-old and had a well-deserved reputation as a playboy. She was only 19. They flashed briefly in the romance firmament and then, in 2010, fell to earth with a bump. Taylor took the "wronged much younger woman" approach in her song "Dear John". He, of course, didn't agree, saying that she was kicking a guy when he was down.</p><h2 id=miley-cyrus><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Miley Cyrus</span></h2><p>In 2015, for no good reason other than she likes to stir things up, Miley Cyrus announced to&nbsp;The New York Times that she has no interest in being part of Taylor Swift's squad of "famous" people. Her friends, she told the paper, were normal people who inspired her, implying that Swift and her brigade were boring rich people. That's as opposed to Miley, an un-boring rich person. Taylor and Miley aren't chums.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's What Miley Cyrus Has Done Since Divorcing Liam Hemsworth</a></span></p><h2 id=rihanna><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Rihanna</span></h2><p>Well, Ri-Ri collaborated with Calvin Harris on a song. That was bad enough. But then she came out and said that she had no interest in being part of Swift's squad. It was a kind of a slap in the face something like the fact their brands just didn't match, as if Taylor was some kind of "goodie two shoes". The negative vibes are subtle, but they are there.</p><h2 id=lady-gaga><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Lady Gaga</span></h2><p>When Gaga first met Taylor, Swift was gushing about how much she like her music, the song "Applause" in particular. She went on and on and on. Gaga's take was that she was full of sh*t. And she said so. There was some bad blood, but then it turned out that Taylor really was a fan. So, Gaga decided to play nice. No word on how Taylor felt.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lorde><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Lorde</span></h2><p>Lorde is the New Zealand singer who shot to fame with&nbsp;Pure Heroine.&nbsp;In 2013, she actually called Swift out for being too perfect and too pretty. It makes fans feel bad, she said. She then, kind of, becomes chums with Swift and&nbsp;says that the friendship with the singer is like being with someone with an auto-immune disease, meaning, we think, Swift is very restrictive about what she will and won't do. We don't think those two are hanging at the moment.</p><h2 id=tina-fey-and-amy-poehler><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Tina Fey And Amy Poehler</span></h2><p>During the 70th Golden Globes, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tina Fey and Amy Poehler</a> are doing the snappy banter, joking about how Taylor Swift breaks up with boyfriends and then writes songs about it. Tina even throws in that may she just needs some "me" time to finally get to know herself. Read between the lines: Grow up. Ha-ha says, everybody. Not so Taylor. She was mightily displeased. Still is.</p><h2 id=kendall-jenner><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Kendall Jenner</span></h2><p>Well, a while back, they both fell for Harry Styles&nbsp;of One Direction fame.&nbsp;Not at quite the same time, but close enough. Then there is this "is Kendall in or out of the squad" drama, which seemed to matter to Kendall more than it should have. The simple truth? The two were never really chummy. The PR of Kendall being seen to hook up with Swift was just too good to miss.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp; <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Evolution Of Taylor Swift, In Photos</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirmrGcpL9uv9aina1lkp60qLHSrWScnZyar7O107Jkn52lmcBurdGgrKadnql6psTPpZiippWZfA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftaylor-swift-biggest-celebrity-feuds-argument-explained.html&text=Taylor%20Swift%3a%20The%20Biggest%20Feuds%20Explained&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftaylor-swift-biggest-celebrity-feuds-argument-explained.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftaylor-swift-biggest-celebrity-feuds-argument-explained.html&title=Taylor%20Swift%3a%20The%20Biggest%20Feuds%20Explained" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftaylor-swift-biggest-celebrity-feuds-argument-explained.html&title=Taylor%20Swift%3a%20The%20Biggest%20Feuds%20Explained" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftaylor-swift-biggest-celebrity-feuds-argument-explained.html&title=Taylor%20Swift%3a%20The%20Biggest%20Feuds%20Explained" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftaylor-swift-biggest-celebrity-feuds-argument-explained.html&description=Taylor%20Swift%3a%20The%20Biggest%20Feuds%20Explained" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./tru-life-rick-ross-velous-bag-behind-the-scenes-445536.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Go Behind-The-Scenes Of Tru Life, Rick Ross &amp;amp; Velous Bag For It Video Shoot">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./sarah-lacina-bio-wiki-age-height-parents-husband-and-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sarah Lacina Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Parents, Husband, and Net Worth">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
