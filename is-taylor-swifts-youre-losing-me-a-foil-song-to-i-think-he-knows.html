Throughout their relationship, the pair opted to keep out of the spotlight, often walking red carpets solo even when attending the same events. Shortly after the breakup, a source exclusively told Us Weekly that Swift’s celebrity status contributed to the twosome calling it quits.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Fans have since recognized that <a href=#>Swift and Alwyn’s romance</a> may have turned rocky <a href=#>long before they</a> officially parted ways, with Swift’s anxieties around her publicized life being too much to handle appearing in songs like “The Archer,” “Peace” and more.</p><p>While Swift has never confirmed who her songs are about, fans are sure to get more insight into her and Alwyn’s relationship when The Tortured Poets Department hits shelves on Friday, April 19.</p><p>“I needed to make it. It was<a href=#> really a lifeline</a> for me,” she told concertgoers at a February Eras Tour show in Melbourne, Australia. “It sort of reminded me of why songwriting is something that actually gets me through life and I’ve never had an album where I’ve needed songwriting more than I needed it on Tortured Poets.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKCsZaSWxq270WaqsKGWqcBuxc6uqZ5lnKTAqrrGZqSeZZFis7C1y2aqqKaXYsGwechmq6GhnqB6qbGMpKWor6Nk</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fis-taylor-swifts-youre-losing-me-a-foil-song-to-i-think-he-knows.html&text=Is%20Taylor%20Swift%27s%20You%27re%20Losing%20Me%20a%20Foil%20Song%20to%20I%20Think%20He%20Knows%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fis-taylor-swifts-youre-losing-me-a-foil-song-to-i-think-he-knows.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fis-taylor-swifts-youre-losing-me-a-foil-song-to-i-think-he-knows.html&title=Is%20Taylor%20Swift%27s%20You%27re%20Losing%20Me%20a%20Foil%20Song%20to%20I%20Think%20He%20Knows%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fis-taylor-swifts-youre-losing-me-a-foil-song-to-i-think-he-knows.html&title=Is%20Taylor%20Swift%27s%20You%27re%20Losing%20Me%20a%20Foil%20Song%20to%20I%20Think%20He%20Knows%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fis-taylor-swifts-youre-losing-me-a-foil-song-to-i-think-he-knows.html&title=Is%20Taylor%20Swift%27s%20You%27re%20Losing%20Me%20a%20Foil%20Song%20to%20I%20Think%20He%20Knows%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fis-taylor-swifts-youre-losing-me-a-foil-song-to-i-think-he-knows.html&description=Is%20Taylor%20Swift%27s%20You%27re%20Losing%20Me%20a%20Foil%20Song%20to%20I%20Think%20He%20Knows%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./joyner-lucas-acting-mark-wahlberg-1234707211.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Joyner Lucas To Make Acting Debut Alongside Mark Wahlberg">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./deshawn-jagwan-was-in-an-accident-woodrow-wilson-high-school-basketball-player-passed-away.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Deshawn Jagwan Was In An Accident, Woodrow Wilson High School Basketball Player Passed Away The Talk">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
