As the show’s official bio describes, Nicole is a “sweet-talking, hammer-swinging whirlwind”. An advocate for the preservation and restoration of architecture, Nicole is not the one to give up on homes. But instead of restoring old age homes to match modern standards, Nicole attempts to restore the homes to their former glory. Over the years, Nicole has worked in Saint Paul, Minneapolis, Detroit, and Akron. Her work is primarily centered around pre-World War II homes. In this article, we will take a closer look at the wiki-bio of Nicole Curtis.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Early Life:</h2><p>Nicole Curtis was born on the 20th of August 1976 in Lake Orion, Michigan USA. Born to Joanie and Rod Curtis, Nicole spent much of her early life with her brother Ryan Curtis. The family owned a garbage collection business that taught Nicole the glory of restoration. As a young kid, Nicole went to Lake Orion High School and graduated from high school in 1944. Following her high school graduation, Nicole enrolled at Michigan to Study Law but transferred to Florida University to study education. While still at college, Nicole got pregnant with her first baby, Ethan, and had to leave college to find a job to take care of the baby.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/thecelebsinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/website-55.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Professional Career</h2><p>Alone and pregnant, Nicole was running out of time to find a job. But instead of finding a job, Nicole decided to create a job and started a cleaning business. At the same time, Nicole started working for a license as a realtor. At the time, Nicole was married to Steve Lane, who helped her get by. However, the pair called it quits in 2009, and Nicole was left to her own devices.</p><p>After developing a mind for business, Nicole shut down the cleaning business and shifted her focus to an antique store. After gathering her realtor’s license, Nicole began working in the Minneapolis area but slowly expanded to include other locations. As her fame grew, Nicole was scouted by Magnetic Productions, who wanted her to star in the show, Sweat Equity.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Rehab Addict</h2><p>After a one-off appearance in Sweat Equity, Nicole landed her TV show entitled, Rehab Addict. The series aired on the DIY Network and premiered on the 14th of October 2010. The series became an instant hit with the fans. Since then, Nicole has made appearances in several other series including Daryl’s Restoration Over-Hall, Beach Flip, and Home & Family.</p><p>Apart from her TV life she also spent her quality time on writing too. On the basis of her struggle and dedication to her work, she has revealed her opinion regarding her work in her Autobiography book “Better Than New: Lessons I’ve Learned from Saving Old Homes (and How They Saved Me)”&nbsp;which she published on&nbsp;October 18, 2016.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Television Career</h2><p>Here is a timeline of Nicole Curtis’s television career:</p><ul><li><strong>2010</strong>: She debuts as the host and producer of&nbsp;Rehab Addict, a show where she restores old houses in Detroit and Minneapolis.</li><li><strong>2014</strong>: She appears as a guest on&nbsp;Daryl’s Restoration Over-Hall, a show where singer Daryl Hall renovates his historic home in Connecticut.</li><li><strong>2018</strong>: She wraps up the eighth and final season of&nbsp;Rehab Addict&nbsp;after being on the air for eight years.</li><li><strong>2022</strong>: She returns to TV with a new show called&nbsp;The Kardashians – An ABC News Special, where she serves as a coordinating producer.</li><li><strong>2021</strong>: She launches another show called&nbsp;Rehab Addict Rescue, where she helps DIY homeowners who are struggling with their own renovation projects.</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-284e5e2e-74f4-4bc7-b3e4-987fae8e1c82>Controversy</h2><p>Back in 2013, Nicole and her company bought a house for $2 from the city of Minneapolis, whose renovation time was allocated to be a year. Unfortunately, they failed to renovate the old house in the proposed time, which finally turned down to a lawsuit from the City of Minneapolis. The lawsuit was later settled in 2017, while there have been no further details made available.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Net Worth</h2><p>Nicole Curtis is also a licensed realtor, interior designer, and television personality who has an estimated net worth of $3 Million.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Personal life</h2><p>Nicole gave birth to her first son, Ethan, with her ex-husband Steve Lane in 1996. The pair called things off in 2009 and Nicole began dating Shane Maguire. The pair split soon after, but Nicole fell pregnant with her second child, Harper. Following the pregnancy, Shane filed paternity and joint custody. While the court agreed, Nicole attempted to block Shane from having overnight custody until Harper’s second birthday. She argued that the baby needed to be breastfed and needed more care. The couple even argued over Harper’s name who was born in May of 2015. Talking about the legal battle, Nicole wrote on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a>,</p><p>“Just like that, my little one jumps into my arm and reaches for a breast — I sit for a long time in the car when we do these returns while getting screamed at — put your boob away in my driveway.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Moving on-Boyfriend Ryan Sawtelle</h2><p>Moving on Nicole Curtis found love with Ryan Sawtelle, the executive director and founder of the White Heart Foundation, a military non-profit organization. The couple began dating in 2017 and has a heartwarming story of how they met.</p><p>Curtis first noticed Sawtelle on Instagram, where he posted about his 8-year-old niece Arden’s battle with a rare and aggressive brain tumor called Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG).&nbsp;Curtis, who had <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">lost</a> her friend’s 9-year-old daughter Tessa to the same disease, felt a connection with Sawtelle and reached out to him to offer her support and prayers.</p><p>They met in person for the first time shortly after Arden’s death and agreed to have a light-hearted conversation with no mention of cancer. They hit it off and Sawtelle helped Curtis shoot a promo for her show, where he offered her a ride on his motorcycle.&nbsp;Sawtelle is also supportive of Curtis’s two sons, Harper, and Ethan, 22, from her previous relationships. The couple celebrated their one-year anniversary in July 2019 and shared some sweet photos of their trip to New Jersey on Instagram. Curtis and Sawtelle do not have kids together and yet to get married as of 2023</p><p>are clearly happy and in love, and they have overcome many challenges together. They are an inspiring example of how love can heal and bring joy to people’s lives.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Physical Traits</h2><p>Nicole Curtis is a blonde beauty with brown eyes and a charming smile. She has a slim figure and stands at 5 feet 3 inches tall. She often wears casual and comfortable clothes that suit her active lifestyle, such as jeans, t-shirts, boots, and jackets. She also likes to accessorize with hats, scarves, and sunglasses.
