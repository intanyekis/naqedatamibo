This didn’t have to happen.”</p><p>During a press conference on Friday in Las Vegas, Chief Deputy District Attorney Marc DiGiacomo&nbsp;described Davis as the “on-ground, on-site commander” and “shot caller” who “ordered the death” of Tupac Shakur.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Sekyiwa ‘Set’ Shakur and Mopreme Shakur attend the ceremony honoring Tupac Shakur with a posthumous Star on The Hollywood Walk Of Fame on June 07, 2023 in Hollywood, Calif. <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><p>A Nevada grand jury indicted Davis on one count of murder with a deadly weapon and a gang enhancement and he was arrested Friday.</p><p>In his memoir “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Compton Street Legend</a>,” Davis admitted he was inside a white Cadillac with Anderson and two others as they pulled up to Shakur’s vehicle on the Las Vegas strip the night of&nbsp; Sept. 7. 1996 and opened fire. Tupac, 25, was shot four times and died in a hospital six days later.</p><p>Davis wrote in his memoir that Tupac Shakur and his entourage beat up Anderson earlier that night at the MGM Grand hotel after a Mike Tyson boxing match, spurring him and his crew to retaliate.</p><p>Davis has claimed Anderson pulled the trigger in retaliation against Shakur. Both he and Anderson were members of the South Side Compton Crips gang of which Davis claims he was a “five star general”.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">A booking photo of Duane “Keefe D” Davis, photographed off of a television monitor, during a news conference on Sept. 29, 2023 at the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department headquarters on the arrest and indictment for the1996 murder of Tupac Shakur. <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><p>Mopreme said Las Vegas detectives reached out to him a few months ago and reassured him they were still investigating the case.</p><p>In July, Las Vegas Metropolitan Police<a href=#> raided Davis’ Henderson, Nevada home</a> and confiscated several computers, laptops and iPads from the home, as well as .40 caliber cartridges, according to a search warrant obtained by The Post.</p><p>“The timing was very curious and I was a little taken aback because this should’ve happened a long time ago,” Mopreme said.</p><p>“People talk, but that doesn’t mean there was anything to it. And then I found out that the detective on the case suddenly retired. I was just baffled by the bull—t, but someone else in the department did say they were still working on things and it’s moving.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson spoke during a news conference on Sept. 29, 2023 about an indictment against Duane Davis in connection to the 1996 murder of rapper Tupac Shakur. <span class=credit>AP</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">The black car that rapper Tupac Shakur was riding in when he was fatally shot in 1996 as the rapper and Marion “Suge” Knight drove down a street in Las Vegas. <span class=credit>The LIFE Images Collection/Getty</span></figure><p>At the press conference, DiGiacomo said while investigators had the information on what led to the fatal shooting, there were still some holes.</p><p>“What was lacking was admissible evidence to establish this chain of events,” the prosecutor said. “[Davis] admitted within that book that he did acquire the firearm with the intent to go hunt down Mr. Shakur and Mr. Knight.”</p><p>Mopreme Shakur said he it angered him knowing Davis would use his brother’s name and death to gain attention over the years.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">American rapper Tupac Shakur attends a gala in honor of actor Mickey Rourke at Nello’s, in New York. <span class=credit>Sygma via Getty Images</span></figure><p>“It was just a blatant disregard for the memory of my bother, who is the greatest rapper of all time and is an icon,” Mopreme said.</p><p>“I am not a lawyer or a cop, but I do watch a lot of ‘Law & Order’ … and he said so himself that he was definitely involved. He admitted this.</p><p>“But now we are here and I want to know about the motive and any other accomplices. I’m just bracing to see this indictment.”</p><p>Anderson and the other two men who were with Davis on the night of Tupac’s shooting have all died, leaving no other witnesses who have come forward to say what happened that night.</p><p>Mopreme said he plans to be in court once the trial starts. When asked what he would say to Davis if he had the chance, he paused before adding: “I really haven’t really thought about that because I might just black out. I don’t know how much I would be able to control myself.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3Jma3FfqcKxrcJmqqGZm6q%2FtHnBq6atoJWnerSt2Kxkpq2imbKzecKhmKuflWK2tHnBoqutnaKoxKax02g%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftupac-shakurs-brother-says-murder-charge-is-bittersweet.html&text=Tupac%20Shakur%27s%20brother%20says%20murder%20charge%20is%20%27bittersweet%27&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftupac-shakurs-brother-says-murder-charge-is-bittersweet.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftupac-shakurs-brother-says-murder-charge-is-bittersweet.html&title=Tupac%20Shakur%27s%20brother%20says%20murder%20charge%20is%20%27bittersweet%27" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftupac-shakurs-brother-says-murder-charge-is-bittersweet.html&title=Tupac%20Shakur%27s%20brother%20says%20murder%20charge%20is%20%27bittersweet%27" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftupac-shakurs-brother-says-murder-charge-is-bittersweet.html&title=Tupac%20Shakur%27s%20brother%20says%20murder%20charge%20is%20%27bittersweet%27" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftupac-shakurs-brother-says-murder-charge-is-bittersweet.html&description=Tupac%20Shakur%27s%20brother%20says%20murder%20charge%20is%20%27bittersweet%27" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./audra-martin-bio-age-family-salary-boyfriend-height-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Audra Martin Bio, Age, Family, Salary, Boyfriend, Height, Net worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./the-voice-alexa-wildish-parents.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Voice Alexa Wildish Parents:Debbie Mesler Wildish And Dan Wildish">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
