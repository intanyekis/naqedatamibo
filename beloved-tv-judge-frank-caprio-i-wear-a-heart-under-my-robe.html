He’d wake my brother [Antonio] and I up at 4 o’clock in the morning and say to us, ‘If you don’t want to do this for the rest of your life, you’d better stay in school and get a college education.’ That never left us,” he said. “His company had a rule that if people didn’t pay their bill after two weeks he was supposed to stop their milk — and I can remember my father saying, ‘If they have kids, I am not stopping their milk.’</p><p>“Many times he would take a dollar or two out of his own pocket to help them,” he said. “It’s what he taught us — not by his words, but by his actions.”</p><p>Caprio has an especially soft spot for children in his courtroom. “It can be an intimidating experience … <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">and that’s why I bring them up on the bench to participate</a>, and be a leader in the decision,” he said. “Many times I ask them for help in deciding what penalties, if any, to impose against their parents.</p><p>“They give me wonderful answers and are very honest,” he said. “If I were to yell and scream at everyone in the courtoom, demand payment from their parents (which I know they cannot afford) and be strict and cold, it would likely traumatize the children for the rest of their lives.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Judge Frank Caprio in the municipal court in Providence, RI.

Many times they’re single parents who have limited income and are having trouble supporting their children. So I place myself in their shoes: what would I do in their situation? What would my dad do in this situation?</p><p>“I take into consideration people’s personal circumstances,” he said. “It’s amazing that so many times not only have we mitigated a fine and sometimes paid it but we’ve … become involved with some of these people in their personal lives as well in an attempt to help them out.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Frank Caprio and his wife, Joyce, with their children, grandchildren and other family members. <span class=credit>handout</span></figure><p>Caprio remains grounded to his Providence roots and, thanks to his television and social media exposure, he’s been recognized while on trips around the world (including Abu Dhabi and Italy).</p><p>“In my office I have a picture taken of my brother, who’s three years older, and me, when I was 10,” he said. “It’s one of those days when we were up at 4 in the morning and I look like I was starved to death and disheveled.</p><p>“I look at that photo every day … in my heart … that’s who I am,” he said. “That’s how I was when we were kids. My father on one shoulder and my mother on the other giving me advice all the time. That’s where I live. The recognition [from ‘Caught in Providence’] has never made me somebody else.</p><p>“I’m just a kid named Frankie from an area in Providence called Federal Hill where immigrants from Italy settled — and that has never left me.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j29mam5fl7Ktu9Wem2aspmK3trDGnmSfqpGjuG6vwKmpoqddnnq4scCrZJplmJqus8CMrqWdnaJiurp50aiZnmc%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbeloved-tv-judge-frank-caprio-i-wear-a-heart-under-my-robe.html&text=%27I%20wear%20a%20heart%20under%20my%20robe%27&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbeloved-tv-judge-frank-caprio-i-wear-a-heart-under-my-robe.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbeloved-tv-judge-frank-caprio-i-wear-a-heart-under-my-robe.html&title=%27I%20wear%20a%20heart%20under%20my%20robe%27" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbeloved-tv-judge-frank-caprio-i-wear-a-heart-under-my-robe.html&title=%27I%20wear%20a%20heart%20under%20my%20robe%27" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbeloved-tv-judge-frank-caprio-i-wear-a-heart-under-my-robe.html&title=%27I%20wear%20a%20heart%20under%20my%20robe%27" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbeloved-tv-judge-frank-caprio-i-wear-a-heart-under-my-robe.html&description=%27I%20wear%20a%20heart%20under%20my%20robe%27" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./austin-coffey-died.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Austin Coffey died: What was his cause of death?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./i-am-ok-cutting-my-own-hair-internet-mocks-nba-star-jalen-rose-as-he-advises-paying-100-for-haircut.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="'I am OK cutting my own hair': Internet mocks NBA star Jalen Rose as he advises paying $100 for hair">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
