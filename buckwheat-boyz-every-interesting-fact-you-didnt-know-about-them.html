The group was disbanded later on but came back in 2009 because of the popularity of their song, ‘Ice Cream and Cake’ in a Baskin Robbins Marketing Campaign.</p><p>The group was signed to Koch Records where they recorded their first and only eponymous full-length record. The Buckwheat Boyz were credited for forming the basis of the popular internet meme known as ‘Peanut Butter Jelly Time’ after a flash animated music video that featured a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">banana dance</a> got so much attention online.</p><p class=ez-toc-title>Table of Contents</p><span class=ez-toc-title-toggle><a href=# class="ez-toc-pull-right ez-toc-btn ez-toc-btn-xs ez-toc-btn-default ez-toc-toggle" aria-label="Toggle Table of Content"><span class=ez-toc-js-icon-con><span><span class=ez-toc-icon-toggle-span></span></span></span></a></span><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_The_Buckwheat_Boyz_Group_Was_Formed></span>How The Buckwheat Boyz Group Was Formed<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The American music group was formed in 1997 by Marcus Bowen and Jermaine Fuller in Miami, Florida U.S. Dougy Williams and J.J. O’Neal later joined the group. Their focus was mainly <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Miami bass</a> and Baltimore club music. Though the group was short-lived, it has few credits to its name.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Members_of_The_Buckwheat_Boyz_Group></span>Members of The Buckwheat Boyz Group<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><ul><li>Marcus Bowen (vocals)</li><li>Jermaine fuller (vocals)</li><li>Dougy Williams (drums)</li><li>J. O’Neal (keyboard)</li></ul><p></p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Buckwheat_Boyz_Disbanded_After_Jermaine_Fuller_Passed></span>The Buckwheat Boyz Disbanded After Jermaine Fuller Passed<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>One of the founding members, Jermaine Fuller shot a police officer non-fatally on the head and chest on August 13, 2002, after the police officer confronted fuller near a bus stop and a struggle ensued during which at least two shots were fired. He then barricaded himself in an apartment at Maryland Parkway and Reno Avenue in Las Vegas near the University of Nevada where he took two men as hostages.</p><p>Luckily for the hostages, they escaped unharmed by diving out a first-floor window. Despite several attempts by Fuller’s friends and family to convince him to surrender, he did not. There was a recording of a conversation between fuller and his brother-in-law, Snoop Dogg which was played that proved that the latter tried to convince his brother-in-law to surrender.</p><p>The popular rap singer Snoop Dogg tried to persuade Fuller to leave the Camelot apartment unit peacefully. Fuller was the brother of the rapper’s wife, Shante. Snoop Dogg married his longtime girlfriend, Shante in June 1997 few years after he had huge success with his debut album ‘Doggystyle’</p><p>Apparently, Fuller had contacted area television stations during the standoff saying he was related to Snoop Dogg and wanted to talk with the rapper even when the police were trying to negotiate with him.</p><p>The police later entered the apartment using tear gas and flashbang grenades. Almost all the residents were evacuated from the complex so no neighbours or officers got injured or harmed.</p><p>After an 11-hour standoff, fuller was found dead in his bathroom. It was said that he <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">committed suicide</a> because he was seen holding a gun in his right hand. He had a gunshot wound in his right temple. According to the police reports, no police officer had fired any shot. Fuller’s death made the other remaining group members parted ways. The police reported Fuller had no criminal record in the area except if he was from somewhere else.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Groups_Achievements></span>The Group’s Achievements<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>The American musical group song, ‘Ice Cream and Cake was featured on a television commercial and also a dance video contest. The contest was hosted by Baskin Robbins and it began by hosting the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Guinness World Records</a> largest cheerleading dance event in August 2009.</p><p>Also, the Old Dominion University plays ‘Ice Cream and Cake’ at home basketball games at the Ted constant convocation center where there’s always an active crowd expecting dance participation.</p><p>After their song ‘Peanut Butter and Jelly’ gained more popularity, it became featured on television shows such as The Proud Family, Family Guy, The World of Witchcraft version, and also other flash animated series like Super Mario Bros. Z. The Ying Yang Twins made a remix of the song later on.</p><p>After almost two decades later, the dancing banana still fascinates Buckwheat fans worldwide. The Buckwheat Boyz songs are regarded as the legendary old school which is still appreciated by many. No much information is available about the three members of the group.</p><p>The Buckwheat Boyz music group will always be remembered for their collaboration with Chip-man in the song ‘Peanut Butter and Jelly’ produced by Luke Records and Koch Entertainment Label Alliance in 2002.</p><p></p><p><h3 class=jp-relatedposts-headline>Related</h3></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiipaCyo8HGrGWcp51kr7avyrCfnpmkYq%2BwxdlmnK%2Bdoq56qrrTnqmeq6Seu6h5xZqarWWppMJusMidpa1lm6O8uHnAm6aurF2ptaa5jg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbuckwheat-boyz-every-interesting-fact-you-didnt-know-about-them.html&text=Buckwheat%20Boyz-%20Every%20Interesting%20Fact%20You%20Didnt%20Know%20About%20Them&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbuckwheat-boyz-every-interesting-fact-you-didnt-know-about-them.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbuckwheat-boyz-every-interesting-fact-you-didnt-know-about-them.html&title=Buckwheat%20Boyz-%20Every%20Interesting%20Fact%20You%20Didnt%20Know%20About%20Them" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbuckwheat-boyz-every-interesting-fact-you-didnt-know-about-them.html&title=Buckwheat%20Boyz-%20Every%20Interesting%20Fact%20You%20Didnt%20Know%20About%20Them" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbuckwheat-boyz-every-interesting-fact-you-didnt-know-about-them.html&title=Buckwheat%20Boyz-%20Every%20Interesting%20Fact%20You%20Didnt%20Know%20About%20Them" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbuckwheat-boyz-every-interesting-fact-you-didnt-know-about-them.html&description=Buckwheat%20Boyz-%20Every%20Interesting%20Fact%20You%20Didnt%20Know%20About%20Them" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./gwyneth-paltrow-string-bikini-50th-birthday-photo.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Gwyneth Paltrow Dances In String Bikini Ahead Of 50th Birthday  Hollywood Life">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./anayah-rice-htm.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Anayah Rice - Bio, Age, Wiki, Facts and Family">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
