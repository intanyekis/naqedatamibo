With a harsh command from Smith telling Chris to keep his wife's name out of his mouth, this moment went viral with thousands of memes, recreations, and reactions trending all over social media.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Millions of people are divided on the situation, as some people thought that <a href=#>it's not cool to make fun of a woman's condition</a> or defending Smith for being protective of his wife. <a href=#>Celebrities siding with Smith</a> include Tiffany Haddish, Whoopi Goldberg, and his Fresh Prince co-star Janet Hubert. Those that side with Chris felt that Smith was borderline out of control and should have let the joke slide as Chris is doing what he is for many years: a comedian. Longtime collaborator David Spade, Howard Stern, and Judd Apatow stuck to his side, praising him for staying professional despite enduring the outraged Smith's slap.</p><p>Due to this incident, Chris' shows have sold out and his name has been skyrocketing into more recognition. What people should know that are not familiar with the former SNL star is that Chris never had it easy in the first years of his life. Here, we are taking a look at an aspect of his childhood, which is growing up with his siblings. Who are they, and what do they do as Chris is the most famous sibling out of all of them?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Chris Rock Breaks Silence On Oscars Slap To Sold Out Crowd</a></span></p><h2 id=younger-siblings-living-normal-lives>Younger Siblings Living Normal Lives</h2><p>Andre was born after Chris in 1967 and has lived a relatively private life even for being associated with the comedian by name and relation. Andre reportedly runs a trucking business, Julius Rock Trucking Inc. His business in Brooklyn was named after their father, who passed away in 1988 after a failed ulcer surgery. Even if he happens to be the most elusive of the Rock family, he has found success through different means. Chris' other younger brother Brian is also one to avoid the spotlight. He does not have a social media presence similar to Andre and is reportedly a church minister.</p><p>As the the only Rock sister, Andi was born in 1985 and was only three when her father passed away. However, she turned out well as she is reportedly working as a therapist specializing in children with autism. Andi lives in South Carolina and occasionally visits her family with a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">photo shared by Kenny</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Real Reason Chris Rock Refused To File Police Report Against Will Smith's Oscar Slap</a></span></p><h2 id=some-of-his-siblings-went-through-tough-times>Some Of His Siblings Went Through Tough Times</h2><p>Through his mother Rosalie and father Julius, Chris is the oldest of seven. However, both he and his other siblings have an older half-brother named Charles Ledell Rock. They share the same father and Charles was born in 1953, 12 years before Chris came into the world. Charles had a tragic life, as he dealt with alcoholism and drug abuse. There is not much known about the oldest Rock brother, but he was reportedly close with Tony. On top of going through alcohol and drugs, Charles was also living in a homeless shelter.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Before he ended up in such a state, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he was the only Rock sibling to hold an MBA</a>. His drinking caused his marriage to crumble and worked as a maintenance man at a hospital while living at a homeless shelter. Charles faced jail time for robbery and other petty crimes. In 2005, Chris attempted to help his half-brother by even paying his brother to go to rehab, but he squandered that and down spiraled until his death a year later due to pneumonia.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Much Was Chris Rock Paid To Present At The 'Oscars' And Were His Jokes Approved Before?</a></span></p><h2 id=rock-also-has-siblings-in-the-entertainment-business>Rock Also Has Siblings In The Entertainment Business</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Chris might be the most famous Rock, but some of his siblings also took part in the entertainment industry. Kenny is somewhat a combination of Chris and let's say Andre. He has appeared in movies such as Vesuvius and Coincidental Killer, earning his role as an actor. Even with Chris' fame, Kenny has described his oldest brother as an introvert outside of work. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kenny also revealed that he and Andre share the same birthday.</a></p><p>Jordan, Chris' youngest brother and the baby of the family, born in 1991, followed his brother's footsteps in becoming an actor and comedian. He recently appeared in the movie Big Time Adolescence, where he costars with Pete Davidson. Some have considered him to be the younger version of Chris, as their paths are somewhat similar, including dropping out of high school and pursuing comedy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Last, but not least, Tony also followed suit in being an entertainer like Chris. He has done standup and has roles in sitcoms including Living Biblically and All of Us. He even made a guest appearance in Everybody Hates Chris as Uncle Tony, which is based on their actual uncle. Regarding the situation between his oldest brother and Smith, Tony provided his own statement regarding <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Smith's apology</a>. With a simple <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"No,"</a> Tony stood by his brother and made it clear that his brother deserved better than Smith's apology he posted on Instagram. His relationship with Chris proves how tightknit they are, even when a family member is threatened.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Chris Rock Gets Real About Life With Help From Therapy And Discusses New Role In 'Fargo'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddlr%2BmecKhqaKrXae8pLfSZqqimpyeu6i%2Fjg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-are-chris-rocks-siblings.html&text=Who%20Are%20Chris%20Rock%27s%20Siblings%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-are-chris-rocks-siblings.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-are-chris-rocks-siblings.html&title=Who%20Are%20Chris%20Rock%27s%20Siblings%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-are-chris-rocks-siblings.html&title=Who%20Are%20Chris%20Rock%27s%20Siblings%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-are-chris-rocks-siblings.html&title=Who%20Are%20Chris%20Rock%27s%20Siblings%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-are-chris-rocks-siblings.html&description=Who%20Are%20Chris%20Rock%27s%20Siblings%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-xandra-pohl-fans-speculate-alix-earle-and-budding-influencer-had-a-fallout.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Xandra Pohl?
