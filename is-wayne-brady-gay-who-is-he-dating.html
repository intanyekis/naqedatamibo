Well, pansexual and gay are different sexualities, but both people date men.</p><p>Talking about his dating life, he has confessed to being attracted to men at times in his life, but he has never dated a man. He said that he was always scared to date a guy in his life, and his upbringing and today’s world made his decision hard. He also <span style=text-decoration:underline>stated</span>:</p><p><strong>What’s the fastest way to hurt another man? I’m gonna call you out of your name. I’m gonna call you gay. I’m gonna emasculate you. I’m gonna use the F-word. I learned that very early from the people around me, they’re like, Oh, so those are bad things? Yeah. You, you don’t wanna be that.</strong></p><p>Continuing the interview, Wayne also said that he was already bullied about a bunch of other shit, and he didn’t want to add a top hat on top of that suit and be called gay. However, he also mentioned that he has been in a wonderful community of friends who are in the LGBTQ+ community and who have given him the courage to come out as pan.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-wayne-brady-currently-dating></span>Who Is Wayne Brady Currently Dating?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Wayne Brady</strong> has faced many ups and downs in his love life.

I can be the best dad that Maile needs. I can be the best friend to Mandie, the best son to my mother, and one day, the best partner to someone, because I’m doing this for me. Not dating yet though!
